Rarely is a developer or engineer pictured as being female or looking like me. We need to change that.\" /><blockquote><p>The journey of a Developer that has the pleasure and gratitude of having WordPress as a resource.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Who am I and am I good?</h3>\n<p>We define ourselves in order to navigate life. Like we brand our business, our clients&#8217; website, we brand ourself as well. Remember to define yourself, because others are always going to be doing it for you. Be true to yourself.</p>\n<p>I recall the scene in the movie starring Audrey Hepburn and Rex Herrington where he&#8217;s improving her social standing, at the end his manners are called into question. His response, &#8220;You see, the great secret, Eliza, is not a question of good manners or bad manners, or any particular sort of manners, but having the same manner for all human souls. The question is not whether I treat you rudely, but whether you&#8217;ve ever heard me treat anyone else better.&#8221;</p>\n<p>We are all the same, yet different. We all hurt and desire, yet what we are motivated by may be different. Be true to yourself to follow what you know is meant for you. Trust in the journey. For it is the journey, not the destination that not only makes up one&#8217;s day, but ultimately defines us once we have arrived!</p>\n<h3>Embrace your Uniqueness</h3>\n<p>In sixth grade the upcoming graduation book requested what would you like to do&#8230; while most the girls wrote modeling, acting (we are in Southern California after all) I wrote discover a new animal. Discovery has always been one of my passions. WordPress has been a way to discover new ways to combine code to &#8216;make things happen&#8217; by creating plugins. WordPress has provided a place to practice the developers&#8217; craft. I&#8217;m a working dev and I have a lot of thanks to give the WordPress community for that. I have been given time, support, and much patience. The meetups have provided a place to gain the ground work of what concerns that would need attention and what would be good practices to put in place to ensure site performance.</p>\n<p>Have courage of trying and failing and trying again. Practice the art of asking lots of questions. Remember, &#8220;sometimes it is the people who no one imagines anything of, that do the things that no one could imagine.&#8221; So even if someone questions your work, whether you could ever possibly have done that or do that, keep going.</p>\n<h3>Stereotypes</h3>\n<p>Imagine an engineer writing a program, a developer creating an application, and a social media specialist crafting creative content. Do you see them at their desks? What does the engineer look like? What does the developer look like? Did you picture anyone of them as a female? Typically not, perhaps the one crafting creative content was pictured as female.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Rarely is a developer or engineer pictured as being female or looking anything like me. We need to change that.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It’s been proven that when given identical resumes with name either David or Maria, the hiring committee will determine David to be identified as more qualified every time. Maria’s accomplishments had to be 2 times more in stature before being seen as equally as qualified as David. We hold ‘implicit biases’ both men and women, it is a cultural thing that men are seen as more qualified as a developer. Acknowledging this is the first step. What can we do to help turn this around? First let’s visit why we should turn this around.</p>\n<h3>Reason for diversity (focusing on women in engineering)</h3>\n<p>We are facing very real large complex problems as a community that requires developers to figure out. Specifically, in the WordPress world, we need a platform, themes and plugins that appeal to a large audience. True innovation requires a diverse team. It will ensure that different viewpoints, ideas, and solutions are discovered.</p>\n<p>Women are an asset to the team, especially in the role of developer. Consider the fact that many women are making the buying decisions whether directly making the purchase or helping with the decision. A woman on the team as a developer helps to create a product that appeals to a larger audience and ultimately higher sales. Female developers will bring insight to the possibilities of products that are currently missing and overlooked.</p>\n<p>How to change this? Hire more women as developers. Make it point to include describing/depicting developers as women in marketing materials and encourage women to apply for developer positions.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you’re female reading this, you like to problem solve and build things, give development a try.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Just because things are the way they are doesn’t mean they have to stay that way. Typically, women aren’t developers but that can change. WordPress is a community in which women developers can thrive. WordPress is stronger as a community because of its diversity of users and creators of WordPress. We all benefit from diversity. By having diversity within our community we grow, we build. Ultimately, we create more opportunity for all.</p>\n<h3>Some obstacles facing girls entering sciences</h3>\n<p>Woman as developers are viewed as being different. Many are questioned why they are doing this. Women will even be looked at like she shouldn’t be there. Women are conditioned from a young age to be princesses, not engineers. Developers are competitive, like great writers. Competitiveness for the best projects is part of the game. This game is not something that females get ‘taught’ or necessarily have experience at. Men joke with each other differently than women do. Entering the environment from a female perspective, it may seem aggressive and uninviting.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It helps to have experience in team sports to help to manage and navigate the competitive male dominated culture of the field.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Another way to ensure success is to join a group that supports women in tech. It will help to deal with issues that arise and gain confidence to deal with a group that is dominantly male oriented. Typically, women and men communicate differently. Also, I find it a way to relax and relate without needing to worry about so many other unrelated issues. It provides a platform to discuss issues like family, which many times a big impact on a woman’s career, especially when she has children.</p>\n<h3>Feminine aspect</h3>\n<p>Balancing being feminine in a male dominated field can be difficult. According to Marilyn vos Savant, the person with the highest IQ at 200 and famous advise writer, states that women who play up their sexual attractiveness make themselves appear ‘lightweight’ and lose ‘parity’ with men. This is not okay, since a woman faces pressure in society to look attractive and be nurturing, similar to how men are valued by being a provider. This is a real dichotomy. Women are not allowed to be seen as sexually attractive and competent. It is as if there’s a choice to be made. That is a real problem.</p>\n<h3>What the WP community has done for me</h3>\n<p>WordPress has been found to be a community of people who like to think about technical things/questions. Over the years it has grown more and more toward a marketing and business focus as WordPress grew and continues to grow in popularity creating more and more opportunity and needs to fill.</p>\n<p>I found the community to be a place to bring questions to. It has been a place to find inspiration and to inspire others in my professional journey as a developer. The community has helped me to develop the courage and determination to secure a position as a developer. The WordPress community has been a resource of a network of individuals to turn to for help. It is an open source and sharing community with many talented people.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Elizabeth Shilling, a developer with a degree in psychology with a social, developmental emphasis from UC Santa Barbara, specialized in biological sciences, computer science, business, and teaching. Looking at differences between men and women in math and sciences bloomed during research as an undergrad. It was determined to be cultural, not biological. Social expectations dominate the direction of female students away from engineering sciences rather than intellectual capabilities.

Speaker announcements continue to roll out and the recommended hotels are getting booked up at the height of tourist season. As of yesterday, more than 300 of the 500 tickets for <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-2017-announces-speakers-opens-registration-for-contributor-day\" target=\"_blank\">Contributor Day</a> have been claimed.</p>\n<p>This year organizers are <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-2017-to-experiment-with-sponsors-workshops\" target=\"_blank\">experimenting with sponsor workshops</a>, a perk targeted at the highest levels of sponsorship, which includes Administrator (€ 38,000) and Super Admin (€ 75,000) tiers. This new item in the sponsor&#8217;s package is described as a &#8220;sponsor &#8220;track&#8221; in the <a href=\"https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/files/2016/12/wceu17-sponsorship-kit_122916.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">sponsorship kit brochure</a> and allows sponsors to hold a talk or a workshop in a dedicated space that accommodates approximately 200 people.</p>\n<p>In an effort to prevent the event from disproportionately focusing on mega sponsors, the organizing team has created a <a href=\"https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/03/23/wordcamp-europe-2017-sponsorship-exclusively-for-small-business/\" target=\"_blank\">new sponsorship package exclusively for small businesses</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We recognized that our sponsorship tiers were more geared towards larger WordPress businesses and felt we were not giving small businesses enough opportunity to showcase their products and services and allow them to connect to attendees,&#8221; WCEU Sponsorship co-organizer Remkus de Vries said. &#8220;This is why we created the SMB tier and we hope many see this as a wonderful chance to show off their products and services for what&#8217;s shaping up to be more than 3,000 attendees.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Small Business sponsorship level is priced at € 2,500 and is available to companies that generate the majority of their revenue from WordPress and made less than 1 million euro in revenue in 2016. It qualifies the sponsor for a booth in the middle of the event. The table, banner printing, and setup are all handled by the WCEU Sponsor Team.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Similar to TechCrunch’s Startup Alley, we want to help highlight smaller companies or ones that have just started out,” WCEU Sponsorship co-organizer Noel Tock said. “Simply seeking out sponsorship funds the fastest way possible would not be fair to attendees. This helps makes the conversations and experiences a lot more diverse and balanced.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There are 10 remaining Small Business sponsorship slots, along with 288 micro-sponsorships (€ 150.00). Potential sponsors can <a href=\"http://wceurope.polldaddy.com/s/wordcamp-europe-2017\" target=\"_blank\">apply on the WCEU website</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 18:33:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"WPTavern: WordPress 4.8 Will End Support for Internet Explorer Versions 8, 9, and 10\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=69314\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-8-will-end-support-for-internet-explorer-versions-8-9-and-10\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4371:\"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ie-logo.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Over the weekend, Matt Mullenweg announced that the upcoming WordPress 4.8 release will <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/04/23/target-browser-coverage/\" target=\"_blank\">drop support for IE versions 8, 9, and 10</a>. Core contributors have been <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/02/28/the-new-editor-and-browser-support/\" target=\"_blank\">discussing</a> <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/03/13/continued-discussion-on-browser-support/\" target=\"_blank\">browser support</a> for the past two months in relationship to setting technical requirements for the new editor.</p>\n<p>Microsoft <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/End-of-IE-support\" target=\"_blank\">discontinued support for IE 8, 9, and 10</a> in January 2016, which means these versions no longer receive security updates. Mullenweg said that attempting to continue supporting these browsers is holding back WordPress development.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I realize that folks still running these browsers are probably stuck with them because of something out of their control, like being at a library or something,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;Depending on how you count it, those browsers combined are either around 3% or under 1% of total users, but either way they’ve fallen below the threshold where it’s helpful for WordPress to continue testing and developing against.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In an effort to determine how many people are still using these insecure and obsolete browsers, Jonathan Desrosiers collected data from three different sources. The following are numbers for global IE usage published by StatCounter&#8217;s <a href=\"http://gs.statcounter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">GlobalStats</a>, which Desrosiers said are nearly identical to WordPress.com&#8217;s numbers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>IE8: 0.41%</li>\n<li>IE9: 0.26%</li>\n<li>IE10: 0.26%</li>\n<li>IE11: 3.79%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WordPress will not stop working entirely in these browsers, but after the 4.8 release contributors will no longer test new features against older versions of IE. Some capabilities in wp-admin may be more limited. Mullenweg confirmed that the next versions of TinyMCE will no support older IE versions.</p>\n<p>Global IE usage has declined from 7.44% in March 2016 to 4.18% in March 2017. IE marketshare has been shrinking as mobile device usage has gone up. October 2016 marked the first month in history that <a href=\"http://gs.statcounter.com/press/mobile-and-tablet-internet-usage-exceeds-desktop-for-first-time-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">mobile and tablet traffic exceeded desktop usage worldwide</a>. As this trend of declining desktop usage continues, IE will likely be buried within a couple of years.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have been hard pressed to find a U.S. government agency running a version of IE less than 11,&#8221; WordPress lead developer Andrew Nacin commented on the announcement. &#8220;Government agency websites similarly see negligible traffic from IE &lt; 11.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The decision to drop support for IE 8, 9, and 10 was met with celebration from the WordPress developer community. Focusing on browsers that still receive security updates is a better use of open source contributors&#8217; time and resources. Developers who do client work can also refer to WordPress&#8217; IE support policy when pressured by clients to support insecure browsers.</p>\n<p>Naturally, the topic of raising minimum browser requirements resulted in developers lobbying to drop support for PHP 5.2, which reached end of life more than six years ago. In March 2015, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-version-stats-updated-more-than-13-of-sites-are-running-wordpress-4-1\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress stats estimated PHP 5.2 usage at 16.6%</a>, but that number has dropped steadily to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\" target=\"_blank\">5.1%</a> today. The task of updating a browser to the latest version was designed to be easy for users, but upgrading PHP versions is still somewhat complicated for those who are not receiving help from their hosting companies. The 5.1% on PHP 5.2 represents millions of users who would need to cross a significant hurdle into order to stay current with the latest version of WordPress.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 24 Apr 2017 21:18:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"Post Status: Breaking into and building community, with WordPress and beyond — Draft podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=36524\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://poststatus.com/breaking-building-community-wordpress-beyond-draft-podcast/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1992:\"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/draft\">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\">on iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast\">Google Play</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\">Stitcher</a>, and <a href=\"http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss\">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

WordPress developers <a href=\"https://jkudish.com/2017/04/20/better-plugin-recommendations-for-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\">Joey Kudish</a> and <a href=\"https://secretpizza.party/wordpress-needs-curation/\" target=\"_blank\">Nick Hamze</a> have released a plugin that brings better recommendations to the admin.</p>\n<p>Hamze contends that the first plugins that appear in the featured section have a smaller, niche audience, and are unlikely to be useful to the majority of new users.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/add-new-plugins-featured.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The recommended plugins are slightly better, as they are based on plugins that the user and other users have installed. However, Hamze believes they could be tweaked even further to display plugins that specifically benefit new users. The Recommended tab was <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30337\" target=\"_blank\">introduced two years ago</a> to display results based on plugins that are commonly used together. It excludes plugins that users already have installed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/recommended-plugins.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;I really want to help WordPress but I think what is most needed isn’t a new editor or more guidelines but rather someone to take all the stuff in this fractured ecosystem and bring it together,&#8221; Hamze said. &#8220;Get rid of all the crap and only show people the stuff worth using.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hamze said he doesn&#8217;t know if WordPress can solve this problem diplomatically with code. He believes manual curation is required to deliver the best new user experience. A <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/34212\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> for re-thinking the default &#8216;Add Plugins&#8217; tabs/filters was is open on WordPress trac, as the plugins that appear in these screens have remained unchanged for some time. The ticket hasn&#8217;t received much discussion yet.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-plugin-recommendations/\" target=\"_blank\">Better Plugin Recommendations</a> plugin removes the default and featured recommendations tabs and includes a new recommendations tab curated by Hamze to appeal to new users. Below is an example of the first 10 recommendations the plugin includes:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/better-recommended-plugins.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Hamze uses the following criteria to select the recommended plugins:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Price (Free)</li>\n<li>Numbers of users</li>\n<li>Average Rating</li>\n<li>Last Updated</li>\n<li>Support Given</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When asked why the recommendations don&#8217;t include Jetpack, Hamze said it didn&#8217;t seem necessary, given its high position in the popular tab and the fact that it already comes pre-installed with many hosts.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeherve\">@jeherve</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jkudish\">@jkudish</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jetpack\">@jetpack</a> Haha, I actually like jetpack but since it\'s already at the top of the popular tab and preinstalled almost everywhere, didn\'t seem necessary</p>\n<p>&mdash; Nick Hamze (@NickHamze) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickHamze/status/855389412510674944\">April 21, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hamze and Kudish created a web service that delivers the recommendations to sites where the plugin is installed.

Music was particularly surprising given that he had music on at his desk pretty much all the time, and really enjoyed loading a new CD or record into the media library he had set up at home. One of the songs I remember playing for him was from a band, Manhattan Transfer, that we used to listen to a lot when I was younger and just learning about jazz, I chose <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwL9xf3YQ-4\">Tuxedo Junction</a> because it might cheer him up.</p>\n<p>I remember him smiling faintly. (I wish I had played him more music. I wish I had recorded more of his stories, ideally before he got sick. I wish I had figured out how to navigate the hospital and health care system better.)</p>\n<p>What I didn&#8217;t anticipate was how after <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2016/04/in-memoriam-chuck-mullenweg/\">his death</a> there would be aftershocks of grief that would hit me over and over again, especially while driving or in a plane. I went from crying maybe three times in the past decade to breaking down at the end of a company town hall, when talking to family, when my Mom found out about the anniversary present my Dad had been looking at, and with any number of songs that unexpectedly took on a new meaning.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgKAFK5djSk\">Wiz Khalifa &amp; Charlie Puth&#8217;s See You Again</a>, is obvious, and was in heavy rotation every public place I went; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHCob76kigA\">Lukas Graham&#8217;s 7 Years</a> completely broke me down when it talked about children &#8212; if I ever have any my father will never meet them; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WibQR0tQ0P8\">Kayne &amp; Paul McCartney&#8217;s Only One</a>, the tribute to Kanye&#8217;s daughter and passed mother and I think perhaps his best song; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp-EO5I60KA\">Ed Sheeran&#8217;s Thinking Out Loud</a>, about growing old together, turning 70 as he was so close to doing; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkBKJMTCHGk\">Kanye&#8217;s Ultralight Beam</a> snuck up on me, I didn&#8217;t expect it, but the questioning and gospel and anger and hope in it captured something I didn&#8217;t even realize I was feeling. Even jazz wasn&#8217;t safe, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWeXOm49kE0\">Horace Silver&#8217;s lyric-less Song for My Father</a> had the same effect.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NLZCLKppZs\">John Mayer&#8217;s Stop This Train</a> is a song I&#8217;ve probably heard a hundred times since it came out in 2006, but all of sudden these words meant something completely different:</p>\n<blockquote><p>So scared of getting older<br />\nI&#8217;m only good at being young<br />\nSo I play the numbers game<br />\nTo find a way to say that life has just begun</p>\n<p>Had a talk with my old man<br />\nSaid, &#8220;Help me understand&#8221;<br />\nHe said, &#8220;Turn sixty-eight<br />\nYou&#8217;ll renegotiate&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>I almost had to pull the car over: he was sixty-eight. What I would give for just one more conversation with him like the one the day before he passed. I wish I had written more down, recorded more of his stories, learned more about his journey.</p>\n<p>As the year has passed, the surprise crying is much less common even when one of <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/user/1211384122/playlist/3UiuLpSyYUZduDPkaaCmCA\">these songs</a> comes on the radio. Usually when I think of my father it&#8217;s with a smile. I&#8217;ve even had a few treasured dreams where we&#8217;ve been able to talk, nothing that made much sense (it was a dream) but I remember waking up with an overwhelming feeling of enveloping love. While the &#8220;new normal&#8221; is different, I can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s better &#8212; he&#8217;s still gone.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 22 Apr 2017 05:12:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"WPTavern: Embed Mastodon Statuses in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68788\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"https://wptavern.com/embed-mastodon-statuses-in-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4387:\"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/mastodon-logo.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>After the <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/2017/now-on-twitter-140-characters-for-your-replies\" target=\"_blank\">controversial changes to Twitter&#8217;s @reply feature</a>, which no longer counts usernames towards the 140-character limit, Mastodon registrations rose sharply. <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/\" target=\"_blank\">Mastodon</a> is a free, open source, decentralized network that  has many similarities to Twitter. The software, named in honor of its creator&#8217;s favorite metal band, was launched in October and registered 24,000 users in the first six months. A strong negative reaction to Twitter&#8217;s changes has fueled a spike in Mastodon registrations. In the last week alone, the software&#8217;s user base has grown from 237,000 users on April 15 to <a href=\"https://mnm.eliotberriot.com/dashboard/db/network-drilldown?refresh=30m&orgId=1&from=now-7d&to=now\" target=\"_blank\">more than 414,000 users</a> today.</p>\n<p>Mastodon is different from Twitter in that it is broken up into different independently-hosted instances. Whereas Twitter has struggled to combat trolls and abuse on its platform, Mastodon instances can each declare and enforce their own rules. For example, the flagship <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/about/more\" target=\"_blank\">Mastodon.social</a> instance bans content that is illegal in Germany or France, such as Nazi symbolism and Holocaust denial, excessive advertising, racism, sexism, and other undesirable posts.</p>\n<p>Mastodon&#8217;s Tweetdeck-style interface allows users to post &#8220;toots&#8221; with a 500-word character limit. Toots can also be published with a content warning so that users can choose whether to view it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/mastodon.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>With all the increased activity around Mastodon this week, there was bound to be someone with the desire to display toots on their website. The first plugin for bringing Mastodon content into WordPress has landed in the plugin directory. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/embed-mastodon/\" target=\"_blank\">Embed Mastodon</a> was created by David Libeau, a French developer and Mastodon enthusiast. It allows users to embed toots using a shortcode.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/mastodon-embed.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;I created this plugin because <a href=\"http://www.numerama.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Numerama</a>, a french tech website, was saying that it could be cool to embed Mastodon statuses, like with Twitter, in WordPress,&#8221; Libeau said. &#8220;I was thinking the same when I wrote a small article on my personal blog. I am using both Twitter and Mastodon but want to progressively leave Twitter.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Libeau said he is not a WordPress developer and Mastodon Embed is his first plugin. He does not know if it&#8217;s coded well but said users may be interested in <a href=\"https://github.com/ginsterbusch/mastodon-embed\" target=\"_blank\">an alternative plugin on GitHub</a> that is a complete rewrite of his effort. The rewrite includes multiple embeds, caching, proper shortcode initialization, and fallback to &#8220;direct&#8221; embeds if embed via iframe is forbidden.</p>\n<p>Libeau said he doesn&#8217;t know what will happen to his plugin in light of the rewrite, but he is continuing to develop <a href=\"http://mastodon.tools/\" target=\"_blank\">small tools for Mastodon users</a>. Mastodon has an open API for apps and services, which makes it easy for developers to build things that integrate with it.</p>\n<p>After testing the Mastodon Embed plugin I found that it works but may have a couple of styling issues with the link display. If you find that it&#8217;s not working, it&#8217;s possible that your particular Mastodon instance configuration does not allow embedding via iFrame. To resolve this you may need to contact the admin of the instance or use the fork of the plugin that has a fallback for this scenario. If you find a bug with the Mastodon Embed plugin hosted on WordPress.org, you can <a href=\"https://github.com/DavidLibeau/mastodon-tools/issues\" target=\"_blank\">log an issue on Libeau&#8217;s Mastodon Tools repository</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 22 Apr 2017 03:18:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"WPTavern: Headway Themes Appears to be Dying a Slow Death\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68837\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wptavern.com/headway-themes-appears-to-be-dying-a-slow-death\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9405:\"<p>It&#8217;s been seven months since Grant and Clay Griffiths, founders of Headway Themes, <a href=\"http://headwaythemes.com/the-future-of-headway/\">apologized</a> to customers for failing to communicate on a regular basis and provide adequate customer support. In the apology, the founders admit that the company was experiencing <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/headway-themes-confirms-financial-difficulties-issues-apology-to-customers\">financial difficulties</a> and noted that competition in the WordPress drag-and-drop page-builder space was tough. The duo vowed to communicate more, provide better customer support, and continue to develop Headway 4.0. Has anything changed since the apology was published?</p>\n<h2>Headway Themes Migrates to FlyWheel Hosting</h2>\n<p>In December of 2016, <a href=\"https://getflywheel.com/\">Flywheel</a> hosting <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/flywheel-acquires-wordpress-local-development-tool-pressmatic\">acquired Pressmatic,</a> created by Clay Griffiths. Soon after, Headway Themes migrated to Flywheel hosting which caused a few hiccups such as site downtime due to DNS propagation, login issues, and an issue with the Headway Dashboard. The acquisition raised questions on how it would affect Clay&#8217;s ability to work on Headway.</p>\n<p>“This acquisition and employment will provide myself and my family much more stability than we’ve had in a long time, and will allow me to better focus on Headway in my spare time,” Griffiths said. “This includes rolling out the upcoming 4.1 release, and working hard to make sure the support and other outstanding issues are resolved for all our customers.”</p>\n<h2>Influx Confirms Communication Issues With Founders</h2>\n<p>Soon after the apology, Headway Themes began to use Influx to provide first-tier customer support. <a href=\"https://influx.com/\">Influx</a> provides customer support for companies, including those in the WordPress ecosystem such as <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/\">Advanced Custom Fields</a>. Any issues that Influx couldn&#8217;t solve are escalated to Clay and Grant. In February, Gary Bairéad, a former Headway Themes employee, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/garybairead/status/834823813674188800\">contacted Headway Themes support</a> about the status of Headway 4.0 and received the following response.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>Influx couldn&#8217;t answer the question because Headway developers had not informed them of its progress despite inquiring about it. Influx notes that there may be a beta released in the near future but not to be quoted on it because a similar promise was made five months prior. In January, the official <a href=\"https://twitter.com/headwaythemes\">Headway Themes Twitter account</a> confirmed that Headway was being supported and that 4.0 would be released soon.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/3BugMedia\">@3BugMedia</a> we are fully supporting Headway.  4.0 update coming soon. ^gg</p>\n<p>&mdash; Headway Themes (@headwaythemes) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/headwaythemes/status/816698625380286464\">January 4, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Around the same time period, another Headway Themes customer submitted a support request asking about the status of a longstanding issue they were having. Influx explained that there was a lull because the main developers were failing to communicate. The support representative also pointed out that it seemed the only way for customers to get information about Headway Themes was by emailing support.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>Influx says it tried multiple times to contact Headway Themes developers about the issue and said it was lobbying hard to get it rectified.</p>\n<h2>Payments Stop for Third-Party Block Developers</h2>\n<p>In February, Bairéad <a href=\"https://headwayupdate.wordpress.com/2017/02/03/update-4-dont-renew-3rd-party-blocks-through-headwaythemes-com/\">published a request</a> to third-party block customers to not renew through Headway Themes.com and to instead, purchase and renew directly from the developer&#8217;s sites. Chris Howard, founder of <a href=\"http://pizazzwp.com/\">Pizazz WP,</a> and Chris Rault, co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.headwayrocket.com/\">HeadwayRocket,</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HeadwayRocket/status/826005360834142208\">confirmed</a> they are owed money from customers who purchased and renewed blocks through Headway Themes.com.</p>\n<p>I reached out to both developers to see if they&#8217;ve been paid since February.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve sent Clay a bunch of messages, but he&#8217;s completely ignoring me and hasn&#8217;t paid over another cent since the last long delay,&#8221; Rault said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s down to only 2 or 3 renewals a month, but I’m not receiving anything still. I&#8217;d estimate they still owe me around $2,000,&#8221; Howard said.</p>\n<p>For Howard, the issue of not receiving payments has been <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/headway-3-8-9-patches-potential-xss-vulnerability#comment-200810\">going on for months</a>.</p>\n<h2>Former Support Staff Still Owed Money</h2>\n<p>Headway Themes&#8217; apology does not mention the former support team who the company <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/former-headway-themes-employee-goes-public-staff-has-not-been-paid-and-customers-are-not-receiving-support\">failed to pay</a> on time for months. Since the apology, members of the team have received small payments but are still owed thousands of dollars. Receiving payments from Headway Themes is often a difficult process.</p>\n<p>After not receiving a payment in February, a former team member sent a flurry of emails to Grant and Clay Griffiths inquiring about the payment. Clay eventually responded that they would send out payments when they&#8217;re able too. After a week of questioning when that would be with no response, the team member received a payment.</p>\n<h2>Influx Says Headway Themes is Restructuring</h2>\n<p>A Headway Themes customer recently contacted support to ask about the status of Headway and published Influx&#8217;s response to the company&#8217;s support forums. Here&#8217;s their response:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Hi [Redacted],</p>\n<p>Thanks for reaching out.</p>\n<p>Currently, Headway is going through a restructuring phase to resolve the challenges being faced at this time. We do not have the full details here at support but the main stakeholders are working to return Headway to its rightful mode of operations.</p>\n<p>Please let me know if there are any more questions that I can answer for you. Kind Regards.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To learn more about the restructuring process and what&#8217;s going on with Headway development, I reached out to Grant and Clay Griffiths. Both have not responded to my request for comment.</p>\n<h2>Blox Picks Up Where Headway Left Off</h2>\n<p>Last year, when it appeared the future of Headway Themes <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/headway-themes-future-is-uncertain-amidst-financial-troubles\">was in jeopardy</a>, Maarten Schraven forked the <a href=\"http://bloxthemebuilder.com/start-downloading-beta-blox-theme-v1-0-0/\">Headway 3.8.8 codebase</a> and named it <a href=\"http://bloxthemebuilder.com/\">Blox Builder</a>. Blox Builder is 100% GPL Licensed and is a direct replacement for Headway. Schraven recently <a href=\"http://bloxtheme.com/lots-of-questions-about-blox-theme/\">answered a number of questions</a> related to the project, one of which is how easy is it to transfer from Headway to Blox.</p>\n<blockquote><p>There are different ways to convert your Headway Theme to Blox Theme. The best way is to export your template, you get an .json file. In this file you have to change hw to bt and headway to blox. If you have a large website you also can change the database tables. Some of our users have Blox Theme and Headway Themes side by side and switch between them. The last way (not yet available) is our conversion script. This script can do two things, change the database or do the same search and replace. This script will work automatic or as standalone.</p>\n<p>Or, if you think this is to difficult, you always can ask us for the conversion, we can discuss this on e-mail or skype</p></blockquote>\n<p>There&#8217;s no time frame on when the conversion script will be available. If you&#8217;re a fan of the way Headway Themes works and are looking for a similar replacement, check out Blox Builder.</p>\n<h2>Many in the Headway Themes Community Have Moved On</h2>\n<p>A number of devoted fans and customers of Headway have switched to other page builders like Divi, Elementor, and Beaver Builder. What was once a vibrant community-run Slack channel for Headway Themes enthusiasts has turned into a ghost town. There is little hope among them that the company will be able to rebound.</p>\n<h2>Not Much Has Changed</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, the issues that prompted Headway Themes&#8217; founders to issue an apology are still present. There is a lack of communication on the company&#8217;s blog, social media accounts, and to Influx, the company it has outsourced customer support to. The apology dated Sept 13, 2016, was the last post published to the company&#8217;s blog. Former employees and third-party developers are still owed considerable amounts of money and there has been little if any development on the Headway code base.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 22 Apr 2017 02:00:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"WPTavern: HeroPress Partners With WPShout to Offer WordPress Education Scholarships\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=69027\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"https://wptavern.com/heropress-partners-with-wpshout-to-offer-wordpress-education-scholarships\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3468:\"<p>HeroPress has teamed up with <a href=\"https://alexdenning.com/\">Alex Denning</a>, <a href=\"https://pressupinc.com/\">Fred Meyer, and David Hayes</a> of <a href=\"https://wpshout.com/\">WPShout</a> to offer 10 copies of <a href=\"https://wpshout.com/up-and-running/\">Up and Running Second Edition</a> at the deluxe tier.

The name is a combination of the words checkout and decathlon, according to its creator <a href=\"https://foxland.fi/\" target=\"_blank\">Sami Keijonen</a>.</p>\n<p>Checathlon combines elegant typography with a bold, pink accent color to showcase products and services on a business or e-commerce website. The theme was designed by Finnish designer Toni Suni and is Keijonen&#8217;s 13th theme to be listed in the directory.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checathlon-screenshot.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;I had some kind of vision of what I wanted and Toni created a pixel perfect design based on our discussion,&#8221; Keijonen said. &#8220;I’m super happy about the end result. Unfortunately, the design and the theme was not good enough for WordPress.com and the theme was rejected from there.&#8221; Keijonen opted to create a Checathlon Plus plugin as an alternative way to monetize the theme.</p>\n<p>Checathlon has an intuitive way of organizing the content featured on the front page. Unlike many other themes, the front page is not controlled by a custom page template. Once you set the front page as a static page, the Customizer will give access to the service/pricing, products, testimonial, and blog sections.</p>\n<p>The theme includes support for a Pricing page template and a Team Page template. These features make Checathlon more flexible for use on a business, agency, non-profit, or e-commerce website.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checathlon-team-page.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The pricing template has a &#8220;Service and Pricing widget&#8221; area where users can drop in the custom widgets available in the Checathlon Plus plugin. The widgets make it easy for users to set an icon, title, content, price, and a link for each pricing tier, as well as the ability to highlight one tier as featured.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checathlon-pricing-template.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Checathlon was built to support several plugins, including <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/\" target=\"_blank\">Easy Digital Downloads</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-content-portfolio/\" target=\"_blank\">Custom Content Portfolio</a>, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack</a> (testimonials and portfolio). The theme includes styles for the Jetpack email subscription widget and EDD <a href=\"https://foxland.fi/demo/checathlon/downloads/\" target=\"_blank\">downloads</a> and account pages. It&#8217;s also tagged as <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/\" target=\"_blank\">accessibility-ready</a>, which means that it has successfully passed an accessibility audit. Check out the <a href=\"https://foxland.fi/demo/checathlon/\" target=\"_blank\">live demo</a> to see Checathlon in action.</p>\n<p>Keijonen is taking a unique approach by creating a <a href=\"https://foxland.fi/downloads/checathlon-plus/\" target=\"_blank\">Checathlon Plus plugin</a> as an alternative to offering a &#8220;pro version&#8221; of the theme. It extends the theme to include more customizer capabilities, additional widgets, cart customization features for EDD, and two child themes. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/checathlon/\" target=\"_blank\">free theme</a> is available on WordPress.org and <a href=\"https://foxland.fi/documents/for/checathlon/\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a> can be found on the theme&#8217;s website.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 21 Apr 2017 16:25:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"WPTavern: WordPress Plugin Directory Restores Tabbed Interface\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=69139\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-restores-tabbed-interface\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4036:\"<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/tabs.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/CCRDK5WZEM\">Jeffrey Betts</a>\n<p>Last month the WordPress Plugin Directory <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-relaunches-plugin-directory-with-new-design-and-improved-search-algorithm\" target=\"_blank\">relaunched with a new design</a> and improvements to the search algorithm. The new design replaced the plugin pages&#8217; previous tabbed interface with a wall of text, truncated by numerous &#8220;read more&#8221; links.</p>\n<p>The outpouring of negative community feedback on the new design overshadowed many of the helpful improvements. Removal of the tabs was by far the most unpopular design choice in this iteration, as many found it to be confusing and inferior in terms of navigating the information efficiently. Users, developers, and contributors on the redesign <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-redesign-why-so-many-people-feel-their-feedback-was-ignored\" target=\"_blank\">felt their feedback was roundly ignored</a> throughout all phases of the design&#8217;s beta and testing period.</p>\n<p>Four months ago, contributor Jon Ang (@kenshino) opened a <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2328\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> regarding the &#8220;read more&#8221; links, which he described as &#8220;a usability nightmare.&#8221; The ticket was closed as a duplicate of <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2278\" target=\"_blank\">another ticket</a> which received very little discussion. Today, Otto marked the ticket as fixed, <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/5399\" target=\"_blank\">announcing the return of tabs</a> in the commit message:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Change single-plugin view to have tabbed design. Eliminates read-more on all sections except developers and changelog, adds tabs back to interface using CSS to switch between them. Tabs control both main display as well as widgets.</p>\n<p>Known issues: Changelog read-more not working (js issue), developers section is currently split using CSS, future change will split this section into two separate sections.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Members of the Advanced WordPress Facebook (AWP) community, who were among the most critical of the new design, are <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/1473163646079178/\" target=\"_blank\">pleased with the change</a>. The new tabs are subtle, tasteful, and in line with the overall design. They eliminate the clutter that the expanded &#8220;read more&#8221; links created.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/plugin-page-tabs-restored.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The Reviews tab now displays six of the most recent reviews, as opposed the the previous two most recent. This makes it not as easy to destroy a plugin&#8217;s reputation with poor reviews timed to always be visible on the main plugin page. Otto <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/1473163646079178/?comment_id=1473175582744651&reply_comment_id=1473218756073667&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R3%22%7D\" target=\"_blank\">replied</a> to comments on the AWP community, saying that these numbers are not set in stone and that there are good arguments for displaying different sets of reviews, as opposed to simply the most recent ones.</p>\n<p>Two weeks ago the meta team <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-restores-stats-and-links-to-older-versions-of-plugins\" target=\"_blank\">brought back stats and older versions of plugins</a>, a couple of features that were removed in the first iteration of the new directory. Screenshot display is still somewhat clunky, requiring users to click on their browsers&#8217; back button in order to return to the plugin details. Future iterations of the design are expected to address the remaining quirks and issues that users and contributors have raised since the relaunch.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 20 Apr 2017 21:46:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"WPTavern: WordPress 4.7.4 Fixes 47 Issues\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=69141\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-7-4-fixes-visual-editor-incompatibility-with-upcoming-version-of-chrome\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1182:\"<p>WordPress 4.7.4 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/04/wordpress-4-7-4/\">is available</a> and is a maintenance release that fixes 47 issues reported against 4.7. This update includes a visual editor <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40305\">compatibility fix</a> for an upcoming version of Chrome.</p>\n<p>Uploading video and audio files no longer result in <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40075\">broken thumbnails</a> and the REST API received a few enhancements related to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39854\">data</a> <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40136\">handling</a>.

It actually went live two weeks ago, but I wanted to give it time to work out any kinks before broadly promoting it.</p>\n<p>Now, I think we&#8217;re ready for prime time. So, why do we need another place to list WordPress jobs?</p>\n<p>The signal to noise ratio &#8212; both for employers seeking qualified candidates, and for candidates finding quality job listings &#8212; is pretty low across the board in the job market. Most people who hire technical professionals will tell you that it&#8217;s very difficult to find good candidates. And anyone seeking great job opportunities knows how hard it can be to find out the best opportunities, especially at the times you&#8217;re actually looking.</p>\n<p>The goal for the Post Status WordPress job board is to take advantage of both sides of this equation.</p>\n<p>Post Status isn&#8217;t a huge website with tons of traffic. But the traffic I do get is from a highly targeted audience of primarily WordPress professionals, or web professionals who use WordPress as a primary tool.</p>\n<p>By creating a highly targeted job board, I&#8217;m able to increase the signal on both sides; employers can get quality applications, and applicants can find quality employers.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, our team &#8212; meaning <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/profiles/katie-richards/\">Katie Richards</a>, and myself &#8212; go through each employer&#8217;s listing to confirm that it&#8217;s a qualified listing of someone actually hiring, provides relevant information, and is properly described for the available position.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve already got 20+ jobs and counting, and I know many of them have had applications start to roll in, even without public announcement yet.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to submit a job, the process is currently only for Post Status <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/club\">members</a>. We may open that up in the coming weeks, but for now, you can join and post, or if someone from your organization is a member, they can post it.</p>\n<p>Listings last for 45 days (the first listings are being extended out starting today), and will be marketed to the Post Status Club &#8212; now over 900 WordPress professionals &#8212; as well as the free Post Status <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/newsletter\">newsletter</a>, where we&#8217;ll send digests of new jobs.</p>\n<p>In the future, we may create new features for job seekers to keep an even closer eye on available jobs, but for now, the email and listing page are the place to go. And we may build new tools for employers as we get feedback and see demand for them.</p>\n<p>I look forward to this being a valuable resource for the WordPress community. We&#8217;re dedicated to making it work well for a long haul, and we expect general activity to increase as the word gets out that it&#8217;s there.</p>\n<p>So, if you don&#8217;t mind, we&#8217;d love your help to promote this job board, both now and when you hear of companies hiring and people seeking positions. It is a truly great feeling to know that you helped someone find their next workplace.</p>\n<p>So, check out some <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/jobs\">WordPress jobs</a>!</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 20 Apr 2017 13:35:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Brian Krogsgard\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"WPTavern: WordCamp Europe 2017 Announces Speakers, Opens Registration for Contributor Day\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=69083\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-2017-announces-speakers-opens-registration-for-contributor-day\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2015:\"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wordcamp-europe-2017.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Europe 2017</a> has been rolling out <a href=\"https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/speakers/\" target=\"_blank\">speaker</a> announcements over the past week, slowly building what appears to be a strong lineup of both European and international WordPress experts.

This year the survey received feedback from 302 respondents in 61 different countries, a 43% increase in responses from 2015. The top five countries represented in the survey include the United States (27.15%), India (7.62%), United Kingdom (6.95%), Germany (6.29%), and Canada (3.64%). English remains the most popular language for BuddyPress sites at nearly 70% and this year Spanish (10.7%) replaced French for the #2 spot, followed by German (9.96%).</p>\n<p>A new question in the 2016 survey asked users what PHP versions their sites are on. More than 53% of respondents report having sites on PHP 7.0+ and 63% are using a version higher than 5.6+.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/buddypress-php-2016.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Lead developer Paul Gibbs sees these results as an affirmation that the BuddyPress core leadership made the right decision when dropping support for PHP 5.2 nine months ago.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/buddypress\">@buddypress</a>) made the right call 9 months ago to drop support for PHP 5.2 in our last major release.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Paul Gibbs (@pgibbs) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pgibbs/status/849399725707202562\">April 4, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In fact, our 2016 users survey <a href=\"https://t.co/1LClEoOr38\">https://t.co/1LClEoOr38</a> suggests 88% of respondents use PHP &gt;5.6, maybe we can be more aggressive this year.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Paul Gibbs (@pgibbs) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pgibbs/status/849399973649276931\">April 4, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Gibbs is currently on a sabbatical from BuddyPress and was not available for comment. Project lead John James Jacoby said that the decision to drop support for PHP 5.2 may not be a direct corollary to its usage falling below 1%, but the core team will continue to bump the minimum version in the future with consideration for user happiness.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s hard to know whether increasing our minimum PHP version made any direct difference,&#8221; Jacoby said. &#8220;My hunch is most users do not care very much, and the ones that do, care greatly. It’s all about keeping users happy – sometimes that means maintaining compatibility with old dependencies; other times it means kindly motivating users to upgrade things maybe they haven’t thought about in a while.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The 2016 results show that 45% of respondents have been using BuddyPress for a year or less. While this isn&#8217;t necessarily an indication of users&#8217; ability, it is interesting in light of the project&#8217;s recent shift to focus on developers and site builders. The survey results indicate that more users identify themselves as a beginner when it comes to knowledge of BuddyPress themes and hooks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/buddypress-knowledge.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>BuddyPress core developers made the decision to focus on site builders and developers based on how they saw the project&#8217;s user base changing over time. Making the software 100% turnkey is no longer one of their chief objectives. With the high percentage of users who identify as beginners, the project will need to find a way to get them connected and advancing in their BuddyPress knowledge.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/support/\" target=\"_blank\">BuddyPress.org community forums</a> continue to be the best place to get connected with other users to talk about what they’re working on,&#8221; Jacoby said. &#8220;Our documentation coverage in the codex is constantly being maintained, and we’re still working behind the scenes on a developer site ala <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">developer.wordpress.org</a>. Nothing will ever beat reading the code from inside a quality code-editor, but having public visibility into the codebase is good for everyone, too.&#8221;</p>\n<p>April 30, 2017, marks the 8th anniversary of the first stable release of BuddyPress. Version 3.0 will be released this year and contributors are working towards adding a new template pack and improving the BP REST API, in addition to other new features based on comments from the survey.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The primary focus of BuddyPress for 3.0 and beyond (in addition to being a great foundation for developers) should be to improve member management and communications inside your WordPress,&#8221; Jacoby said. &#8220;The latest and greatest versions of PHP don’t necessarily help us with those things directly, but the performance improvements of running BuddyPress on PHP 7.0 or 7.1 are impressive, enough to continue aggressively bumping our minimum required and recommended versions to keep users happy and safe.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/2017/04/2016-buddypress-survey-results/\" target=\"_blank\">summary of the 2016 survey results</a> was published to the BuddyPress.org blog and the <a href=\"https://mercime.github.io/BuddyPress-2016-survey-results/\" target=\"_blank\">full results</a> are available on GitHub, along with comments from respondents.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 19 Apr 2017 19:43:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"WPTavern: New WordPress Plugin Shows Users Where a Plugin’s Settings Link Is Upon Activation\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68829\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"https://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-plugin-shows-users-where-a-plugins-settings-link-is-upon-activation\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2288:\"<p>A common frustration I&#8217;ve experienced in WordPress after installing a plugin is figuring out where the settings link is located. It can be a top-level menu item or tucked away in a sub-menu. Sometimes, the plugin doesn&#8217;t warrant a settings link.</p>\n<p>A new plugin called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/show-plugin-menu-items-on-activation/\">Show Plugin Menu Items on Activation</a> created by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/kellenmace\">Kellen Mace</a> and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/binarygary\">Gary Kovar</a> seeks to calm the chaos. When a plugin is activated, an Admin Notice is displayed that informs the user where to configure it.</p>\n<img />Where to Find Akismet&#8217;s Settings\n<p>The notice can be dismissed by either clicking the dismiss button or hovering over the menu location. The notice does not display for plugins that include a welcome page or wizard such as BuddyPress and WooCommerce.</p>\n<p>The number of admin pointers that are displayed depends on the number of menu items that are added. For example, if a plugin adds three menu items, three admin pointers are displayed.</p>\n<p>When four or more menu items are added, a notice is shown at the top of the screen that says, &#8216;Many new plugin menu items were added.&#8217; If no menu items are added, a notice displays at the top of the screen that says, &#8216;No new plugin menu items were added.&#8217;</p>\n<p>I tested the plugin on WordPress 4.7.3 and didn&#8217;t encounter any issues. Although plugins ought to make finding the settings link easier upon activation, this particular plugin has me wondering if displaying these types of admin notices should be a core feature. In my experience, plugin authors rarely take advantage of admin pointers to explain where to go or what to do next after being activated.</p>\n<p>Related to the above, I encourage plugin developers to <a href=\"https://hugh.blog/2012/07/27/wordpress-add-plugin-settings-link-to-plugins-page/\">read this article </a>by Hugh Lashbrooke, that explains how to add a settings link to the plugins listing page.

To be honest, I was not one of the children or teenagers who knew what they wanted to become when they grow up. And to stay honest, I still don’t know exactly to this day.</p>\n<p>After school I got advised to start working for the government; jobs are well paid and stressless. But considering my tasks, I did not have the feeling that there was any particular skill or performance needed to get them done, nor was there any desirable achievement in the years to come.</p>\n<p>In the following 12 years, I switched administrations and ministries, trying to find more fulfillment and happiness in what I was doing during the day. But sooner or later the daily routine made me feel very miserable and frustrated. I started to realize that though I still did not know what I wanted to become, I knew exactly what I did not want to do anymore: sitting in an office from nine to five, doing the same administrative work, day after day, without any motivation, without any personal goal. There must be more in life for me!?</p>\n<p>My husband, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/schlessera\">Alain Schlesser</a>, at that point also a government agent, was fed up as well and decided to quit his job and start freelancing as a web developer focussing on WordPress &#8211; so at least one of us had a specific goal.</p>\n<h3>Getting Out</h3>\n<p>In summer of 2014 I opted for a four year sabbatical, we sold everything we owned in Luxembourg and moved to the German “Eifel” quite into the middle of nowhere together with our three french bulldogs Jasper, Duke, and Indra. I did not have the slightest idea of where my personal journey would lead me in the end, but I had the feeling that it was time to take better care of myself.</p>\n<p>First, I started studies as a dog health &amp; behavior trainer, which I completed successfully. After the studies, I got sick and depressed. I gained more and more weight, was constantly dealing with all sorts of aches and had severe doubts about what the future might bring to me. And the more I doubted, the less productive I got.</p>\n<p>In summer of 2015 I got the diagnosis that I was suffering from lipedema &#8211; a chronically progressive disease which is basically a very painful fat disorder, that almost exclusively affects women. I decided to completely change my life and focus on my mental and physical health.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, my husband was working hard to achieve his personal goals. At that point I did not have a very clear idea of what he was actually doing during the day, nor was I interested in any details.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I had nothing to do with the web or computers in general, except for Google, Facebook and writing emails.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Coding, programming, developing, those were foreign words to me. A few years back, I had started two blogs on wordpress.com where I shared my dogs’ stories and my experiences during my studies &#8211; that was the only knowledge I had about Alain’s new world &#8211; and about WordPress. Today I agree that these were hard times for us: we spent 24 hours together in the same house but we did not have much to share anymore: I had locked myself out of the life my husband was leading during the day due to a lack of interest and knowledge on one side, and fears on the other.</p>\n<h3>Finding WordPress</h3>\n<p>I entered the world of WordPress because Alain invited me to join him in a trip to WordCamp Europe 2016 in Vienna. Despite looking forward to exploring a new city and do some shopping, I had no expectations of what I was going to experience in Vienna. To be honest,  I was scared of meeting the &#8220;nerdy&#8221; part of my husband&#8217;s life and of not being able to get involved in it &#8211; again. However, what happened in Vienna was totally unexpected and overwhelming for me: I met hundreds of open-minded, interesting, welcoming, friendly and helpful people who were interested in what I had to share with them, although I was not involved at all in WordPress or the community so far.</p>\n<p>I probably had the most inspiring discussions I’ve ever had in my life and one of the funniest and joyful weeks too. There were more than two thousand people, and nobody (!) made me feel uncomfortable, ignorant or out of place.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I have never experienced such an unconditionally welcoming atmosphere before &#8211; and I noticed that I truly wanted to be a part of that amazing community in the future.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To be honest, I actually had withdrawal symptoms once we were back home. I got very active in following up and my Twitter account, which I had registered years ago without ever having tweeted before, suddenly got filled up with WordPress people.</p>\n<h3>Diving Deeper</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_8361-min.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-1705\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_8361-min-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Carole, Alain, and dogs\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a>Only a few days after being back in Germany I started to organize trips to other WordCamps, and in September of 2016 Alain and I traveled together with our three dogs to <a href=\"https://2016.frankfurt.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Frankfurt</a> (Germany) &#8211; both of us as volunteers, and Alain as a speaker too.</p>\n<p>Volunteering felt excellent and right, and we got in touch with the German WordPress Community for the first time. Alain’s talk was a success, and the German community adopted our entire family immediately; we loved seeing our dogs getting spoiled with hugs and treats.</p>\n<p>In October of 2016 we joined <a href=\"https://2016.netherlands.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Netherlands</a> in Utrecht where we once again met interesting and friendly people. Another premiere for me: “How WordPress Saved My Life” by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WordNerdSally\">Sally Mayor</a> was the first talk I ever chose to see at a WordCamp. As you can imagine by reading the title, this was totally inspiring to me.</p>\n<p>Just as with the previous WordCamps, Alain and I hardly spent any time on our own: hospitable organizers, volunteers, speakers, and attendees surrounded us and insisted on showing us the best spots and restaurants in town.</p>\n<p>Two weeks later, we visited <a href=\"https://2016.cologne.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Cologne</a> (Germany) where we looked forward to seeing some of the lovely people we met two months before at WordCamp Frankfurt. I helped out at the registration desk, as I did in Frankfurt &#8211; definitely one of the best opportunities to get in touch with the community.</p>\n<p>At that point, I also took part in my first “Contributor Day”. I participated in the Polyglots team as well as in the Community team, as these don’t require technical knowledge.</p>\n<blockquote><p>At the end of the day, I had localized one free theme into German (which was committed the same day) and joined the discussions for organizing a new type of WordCamp.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As I was more interested in contributing to the community part, I joined Slack and was again diligent in following up. I wanted to become an active part of this community and help create and maintain the welcoming atmosphere I have experienced myself. It worked out very well: I am now a member of the organizing team for a very special German WordCamp with a unique and new concept, to happen in 2018.</p>\n<h3>New Wapuu</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Collage-min.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1707\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Collage-min-300x226.jpg\" alt=\"Wabully with a real French Bulldog\" width=\"300\" height=\"226\" /></a>Another idea was born at WordCamp Cologne: designing a Wapuu with the characteristics of a french bulldog. Meanwhile, our dogs had become an integral part of the German community, who considers our frenchies as the unofficial mascots. Said and done &#8211; by channeling designer skills that I did not even know about, I created the <a href=\"https://wapu.us/wapuu/wabully/\">“Wabully”</a>. Jasper, our nine-year-old male frenchie was the template.</p>\n<h3>Taking Control of Life</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/before_after-min.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-1708\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/before_after-min-203x300.jpg\" alt=\"Before and after a health change\" width=\"203\" height=\"300\" /></a>Besides all the positive and inspiring input for my brain, I took good care of my physical health too. I continued losing weight due to healthy and fresh nutrition, and my fitness level increased because I was doing sports again. My lipedema therapy &#8211; including two surgeries &#8211; was very successful and so my physical and mental health got better and better. In 18 months I managed to lose almost seventy pounds. I was actively taking control of my life again.</p>\n<p>In November of 2016 Alain and I joined our first <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/WordPress-Meetup-Koln/\">WordPress Meetup in Cologne</a>. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ocean90\">Dominik Schilling</a> was sharing his experience during his WordPress 4.6 release lead. I noticed that all this “WordPress-stuff” was not so strange to me anymore; I managed to follow most of Dominik’s testimonies &#8211; and it was interesting to me through the entire talk.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I realized that WordPress was not a mystery to me anymore and that discussions at home must have changed a lot in the past months.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Now I knew the people Alain was talking about, I understood most of the projects and concepts he was referring to, and I was not bored anymore when he was talking about his current development issues.</p>\n<p>I encouraged Alain to book a trip to Philadelphia in December of 2016 to attend <a href=\"https://2016.us.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp US</a> &#8211; an amazing, precious and fruitful experience for him. Unfortunately, I could not join him because of surgery. I admit that I was a bit jealous at that point, but I (rightfully) had a hunch that this trip could be important for my husband and his professional future.</p>\n<p>By coincidence, the only talk I saw online at WordCamp US was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/topher1kenobe\">Topher DeRosia’s</a> presentation of “HeroPress &#8211; The People of WordPress” which was totally inspiring to me. At that point, I would never have imagined that a few weeks later he’d find me and ask me to write an essay for HeroPress&#8230;</p>\n<h3>Using My Powers For Good</h3>\n<p>Earlier that year in spring, I had created a Facebook group for lipedema affected women in Luxembourg together with a friend. Lipedema is largely unknown in Luxembourg and often misdiagnosed as simple obesity. There is almost no help for affected women in my country of birth. I was indeed very lucky having moved to Germany, where the specialists in lipedema diagnosis and treatment are located; otherwise, I would probably not have been diagnosed and treated correctly up until now.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Inspired by my personal success and the growth of our Facebook group I decided, in January of 2017, to fight for a change in Luxembourg together with other lipedema patients.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We have been very active in educational work and we built a significant presence in Luxembourgish media in the past few weeks. The feedback was enormous and we founded a nonprofit association. I knew it would be very useful to create a website to reach more affected women, doctors, and other interested people.</p>\n<p>I accepted the challenge and decided to set up a WordPress site. Alain built a theme according to my ideas and I successfully completed my very first plugin installations &#8211; most importantly for me a page builder called Beaver Builder. I had never imagined how easy, fun and fulfilling building of a website could be! With almost no skills and within a period of seven days only I managed to create lots of valuable content with a nice structure. I admit that living under the same roof with a devoted and passionate developer made some things easier for me.</p>\n<blockquote><p>But besides that, I began to understand what makes WordPress so special: everybody who has something to share is given the possibility to do so by WordPress.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If I managed to do that, why wouldn’t you? There are plenty of possibilities to help you build your website, blog or business &#8211; use them! And many fantastic WordPress people offer their support, contribute every single day to improve the software and to make it accessible for everybody out there. And some specialists offer great courses for absolute beginners like I am, to help them improving their skills.</p>\n<p>We have reached many lipedema patients through my website “<a href=\"https://www.lipoedem.lu/\">Lipödem Lëtzebuerg</a>”, who thank us every day for our commitment as so-called lipedema fighters. I am so happy that lipedema is now a topic of discussion in Luxembourg, which is not only a consequence of our devotion but also due to WordPress allowing me to build a website in a very short amount of time, and with almost no skills. Meanwhile, in collaboration with the National Patients Representation, we have formulated concrete demands concerning diagnosis and therapy to the Luxembourgish Government.</p>\n<p>I am overwhelmed and happy to see how much attention and gratefulness my work and website have earned. It fulfills me in a way that I had not experienced in the past 12 years during my well-paid job.</p>\n<h3>Making a Living</h3>\n<p>It turned out that my enthusiasm and content writing skills were noticed by the CEO of a startup in Luxembourg. I got a remote job offer for writing and managing content on their WordPress website and for being a part of the social media team. We are currently testing a possible cooperation, and I have already been writing some of the content for their website.</p>\n<p>Furthermore I got contacted to work on the elaboration and social media spreading processes of an important lipedema study in Germany as well.</p>\n<p>I was not even actively searching for a job and the offers come rolling in nevertheless &#8211; what an amazing new experience!</p>\n<p>At the same time, I was busy in the last months for the WordPress community:</p>\n<p>As member of an organizing team, I was in charge of finding the perfect location for a WordCamp in 2018. Together with some of my colleagues I have visited some excellent sites in Germany, and I am leading the negotiations.</p>\n<p>Alain and I joined the first German contributor night in Cologne, which was both productive and fun. I proudly presented my very first results of crocheting, which I started in-between my surgeries as a pastime while I needed to stay in bed:</p>\n<table border=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\" width=\"50%\"><a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_8774-min.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1709\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_8774-min-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Small yellow crocheted wapuu\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a></td>\n<td align=\"center\" width=\"50%\"><a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9310-min.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1710\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9310-min-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Crocheted Wabully\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span>In February of 2017 Alain and I have been asked </span><span>by </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BirgitOlzem\"><span>Birgit Olzem</span></a><span> to be part of the organizing team of the </span><a href=\"http://www.wpmeetup-eifel.de/\"><span>WordPress Meetup Eifel</span></a><span>, which we </span><span>both were delighted to accept</span><span>. </span><span>The first Meetup organized by the new team of three will happen at the end of April.</span></p>\n<p>In March of 2017 we flew to <a href=\"https://2017.london.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp London</a>. We were both volunteering and I feel honored that I was part of an outstanding team which made every possible effort to organize a welcoming and amazing event for every single attendee. In terms of inclusivity and accessibility, WordCamp London set high standards: there has been a lactation room, a crèche, a multi-faith room, a quiet room, live transcription of the talks, life essential boxes in women’s and men’s restrooms. Almost every area was accessible to wheelchairs &#8211; with volunteers designated to help in the few spots that weren’t. We had a lovely and inspiring time there and I have yet to follow up with everyone. It makes me feel like my family grows with every WordCamp.</p>\n<p>Last but not least I want to share that I submitted a lightning talk proposal to <a href=\"https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Europe 2017</a> in Paris. It took all of my courage, but I was feeling so honored and inspired by Topher&#8217;s request to write an essay for HeroPress that I realized there might be a story which deserves to be told. I was so proud to have applied as a speaker that it wouldn&#8217;t even matter in the end whether my talk is accepted or not.</p>\n<p>Alain has applied as speaker as well, and we will both help as volunteers again. I can’t wait to be part of this big event. I look forward to seeing friends and meeting new people. It will be my one-year anniversary of being part of the WordPress community &#8211; a year with lots of positive changes and inspiration.</p>\n<p><span>In the end, my talk proposal for WordCamp Europe has not been selected. Of course, I felt a bit sad about this. Even if I was aware that there had been over 300 applications for more or less 40 spots, I had some kind of feeling of having “failed” on my first try… But after having slept on it, I soon got over my deception and I was pleased for Alain for having reached a milestone: his talk proposal got accepted.</span></p>\n<p><span>And most importantly, I decided not to let this discourage me from applying as a speaker again. There are other WordCamps and all things happen for a good reason: I was pondering for weeks if I should attend </span><a href=\"https://2017.berlin.wordcamp.org/\"><b>WordCamp Berlin</b></a><span> or not. I love the community, I love the city but Alain already had other plans. Said and done &#8211; I booked a hotel, bought my ticket, applied as a volunteer and submitted my talk proposal, slightly modified and in German. This time my lightning talk got accepted and I will be a speaker for the very first time at WordCamp Berlin on the 13th of May &#8211; I am more than excited about it. Alain’s plans were changing so that he’s now able to join me with our dogs on my trip to Berlin.</span></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Thanks for joining me in the more \"nerdy\" part of my life, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CaroleOlinger\">@CaroleOlinger</a> ! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WCFRA?src=hash\">#WCFRA</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/VuTHtW3EkP\">pic.twitter.com/VuTHtW3EkP</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Alain Schlesser (@schlessera) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/schlessera/status/772411090672156672\">September 4, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>I hope that I can give something back to the WordPress community with what I’m doing. I am a true WordPress community lover by now. I would like to encourage the people out there to use WordPress &#8211; especially when they think they don’t have enough skills to build a website. There is no such a thing as “I can’t do this.” &#8211; Yes, you can! As long as you have something to share with the world, or a business idea or any other motivation that drives you &#8211; just spread it. WordPress gives you the opportunity to be whoever you want to be and to give yourself a voice.</p>\n<h3>WordPress Is For You, No Matter Who You Are</h3>\n<p>Furthermore I would love to see every WordPress user, blogger, developer, programmer, designer &#8211; and even more so their respective partners &#8211; joining the nearest WordCamp (or Meetup) and meeting the amazing WordPress community! Especially when you haven’t done this so far. You’ll be able to find inspiration and friends, develop unknown personal skills, gain new perspectives on your job or life and, in any case, learn a lot, just like I did. And last but not least &#8211; it can even bring your relationship to a whole new level.</p>\n<p>I still have no idea where my personal journey will lead me in the end but I have this growing feeling that WordPress could be an integral part of my life. Fortunately, it is already a part of me.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: The Only Journey Is The One Within\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=The%20Only%20Journey%20Is%20The%20One%20Within&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fjourney-one-within%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: The Only Journey Is The One Within\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fjourney-one-within%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fjourney-one-within%2F&title=The+Only+Journey+Is+The+One+Within\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: The Only Journey Is The One Within\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/journey-one-within/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/041917-min-150x150.jpg&description=The Only Journey Is The One Within\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: The Only Journey Is The One Within\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/journey-one-within/\" title=\"The Only Journey Is The One Within\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/journey-one-within/\">The Only Journey Is The One Within</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 19 Apr 2017 05:00:18 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Carole Olinger\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"WPTavern: Open Collective is a New, Transparent Way to Fund Open Source Projects\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68528\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://wptavern.com/open-collective-is-a-new-transparent-way-to-fund-open-source-projects\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8728:\"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/open-collective.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://opencollective.com\" target=\"_blank\">Open Collective</a> is a new service that aims to make it easy for individuals, groups, and organizations to raise money in a transparent way. Although many projects have communities ready to offer financial support, the paperwork, taxes, and accounting involved in collecting money under the proper legal entity can be a nearly insurmountable hurdle.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So far, the Internet has been very good at helping people do things together,&#8221; Open Collective co-founder Xavier Damman said. &#8220;But once it involves money, there is no good solution. Creating a new legal entity is too much overhead, too early. What if we could create a virtual entity that can collect money as easily as creating a Facebook Group?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Open Collective was created to eliminate the need for setting up a legal entity in order to raise funds. Groups can set up a collective and begin managing their funds immediately. The two key differentiators of the platform are the ability to raise money recurrently and the built-in transparency. Members of the collective must approve or reject an expense before the money can be used. Unpaid expenses and available funds can be viewed by the public.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ledger-screen.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Open Collective currently has 228 active collectives and <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/opensource\" target=\"_blank\">196 of them are open source projects</a>. Many open source maintainers are finding success raising funds on the platform. <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Webpack</a>, a popular utility for bundling JavaScript files, is one of the most prominent successes, having <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/webpack\" target=\"_blank\">funded its first full-time developer</a> through the platform.

In a recent <a href=\"https://medium.com/open-collective/why-and-how-to-fund-the-open-source-projects-you-depend-on-da62a582307\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Open Collective</a>, Miller said he enjoyed his day job and didn&#8217;t want to leave it to set up &#8220;Preact Inc.&#8221; One of the reasons he chose the platform was to leave room for future key maintainers to be able to access the community&#8217;s resources, instead of cannibalizing them all in his own personal fundraising efforts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you’re fundraising for a community, there’s a clear implication that it’s for the betterment of the project as a whole,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;By putting the project at center stage, as opposed to a person, there’s no need to explain that. In our case, I think it’s why people were so willing to contribute.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The structure that Open Collective provides puts the focus on the community, instead of solely focusing on funding the talents and efforts of the most prominent maintainer. It also gives projects the opportunity to distribute funds to different types of contributors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My advice would be to put channels in place for all the different kinds of support an open source project needs, and offer people clear options: write features, raise issues, make a pull request, do code reviews, give money,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;Don’t try to hide the fact that the project needs funding, and don’t skirt around that fact that it’s specifically about money, or it will come off as disingenuous. If there’s something users want from the project that money can enable, give them an avenue to make it happen.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Open Collective has helped raise more than $200,000 for open source projects on the platform to date. Projects like MochaJS, Babel, GulpJS, Vapor, Qubes OS, and Hoodie have raised thousands of dollars for ongoing maintenance and support. Many of these projects are critical to the open source ecosystem and strapped for resources.</p>\n<p>Although the platform is currently dominated by open source software projects, Open Collective was built to be capable of funding many different types of group efforts. Co-founder Xavier Damman described the platform&#8217;s goals in an <a href=\"http://dataconomy.com/2016/12/xavier-damman-open-collective/\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Dataconomy</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our goal as Open Collective is to create this new light type of association for our generation who really love doing those side projects, creating those meetup groups, taking the initiative to create a conference located in your city, do open source projects together, create movements like occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, all of that. There’s a whole bunch of things that our generation is doing but we don’t have any platform to enable those movements and these communities to collect money. So it’s all about finding a new way, fund those communities that can have a larger impact.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Open Collective&#8217;s co-founders share a strong commitment to open source and the majority of the platform&#8217;s code is MIT-licensed and <a href=\"https://github.com/opencollective\" target=\"_blank\">available on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m a big fan of open source myself and we open source everything,&#8221; Damman said. &#8220;Open Collective is an open source platform because we believe in open source. We believe it’s the future of work. There’s no reason for having two different engineers in two different parts of the world solving the same problem. And also open source is the right business decision. I’m an engineer, as well as a developer, and we tend to make much better code if we know that other people can look at it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Open Collective takes 10% of funds raised by a collective in addition to credit card fees, which are estimated at 3% + $0.30/transaction). The platform&#8217;s fee structure is slightly higher when compared to other crowd-funding and fundraising platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, which charge a 5% fee for successfully funded projects and 3-5% for credit card processing. However, these platforms are more goal-based and not necessarily designed for generating recurring funding. Open Collective&#8217;s fees include use of the platform for managing bookkeeping, taxes, and reimbursing expenses.</p>\n<p>Open Collective for organizations is currently in private beta. It allows local chapters and other organizations to raise money and manage funds without having to open a separate bank account. <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/wwcode\" target=\"_blank\">Women Who Code</a> is an organization that is using the platform this way and has an annual budget of $171,978 based on current recurring donations.</p>\n<p>Money issues can be the source of bitter disputes in communities, especially when maintainers are short on time and neglect to document how donated funds are being used. Open Collective&#8217;s approach to financial transparency is sorely missing in most fundraising platforms, which don&#8217;t require their users to account for how the money has been spent after it is donated. Its built-in transparency and accountability mirrors the values of many open source projects and gives communities a healthy and convenient way to monitor the distribution of funds.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 18 Apr 2017 20:55:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"WPTavern: Automattic to Close San Francisco Office\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68827\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-to-close-san-francisco-office\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3760:\"<p>Automattic&#8217;s San Francisco, CA office is located at 140 Hawthorne.

The event will bring together design and technology experts who will discuss solutions for the ways that digital products and services exclude people.</p>\n<p>Lead organizer <a href=\"http://www.ashleighaxios.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ashleigh Axios</a>, Design Exponent at Automattic, said inspiration for the event came from the exclusion that is everywhere in the industry. Automattic is partnering with Mash-Up Americans and MIT Center for Civic Media to bring awareness to the issue.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Exclusion is all around us, but we don&#8217;t often take the time to understand how it&#8217;s come to be this way, our place in its existence, and our place in combating it,&#8221; Axios said. &#8220;Together, we&#8217;re using research, design, and conversational narrative to open source the prompt to understand the issue of exclusion for further community involvement and refinement.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The schedule for the event includes a message on &#8220;Design and Inclusion&#8221; from Automattic&#8217;s <a href=\"https://x.design.blog/portfolio/john-maeda/\" target=\"_blank\">John Maeda</a> and a session on &#8220;Opportunities Missed from Excluded Voices&#8221; from <a href=\"https://designandexclusionconf.wordpress.com/portfolio/joan-shigekawa/\" target=\"_blank\">Joan Shigekawa</a>, former Senior Deputy Chairman for the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) during the Obama Administration. The conference also includes four panels with experts from Autodesk, Etsy, Airbnb, and other companies.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Design and Exclusion&#8221; is a pointed conference name that puts the spotlight on the problem participants are trying to address. Axios said this name, as opposed to something like &#8220;Design and Inclusion,&#8221; was a deliberate decision. She said that she and John Maeda felt the need to change the language to reflect a new vantage point on the issue in order to garner new insights.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It should now be a well-known fact that technology companies are suffering from a lack of diversity or lack of inclusion in their teams and companies,&#8221; Axios said. &#8220;This is well-reported and the pressure is building to take on this issue from early-childhood education to educating company human resource offices and hiring managers from questioning social and gender norms as relates to professional roles to crediting those who have been doing the work and not having their contributions and presence well acknowledged. This important work has dominated the &#8216;inclusion&#8217; dialogue within technology-enabled spaces for good reason.</p>\n<p>&#8220;However, equally important and much less discussed, are all of the ways in which products and services can be, and often are, designed and built to exclude individuals and people groups, even if unintentionally. We shouldn&#8217;t have to wait until a company crosses the line, creating a public relations nightmare, in order to evaluate the failures in creating inclusive products.&#8221;</p>\n<p>More than 1,000 people have already signed up for a reminder about when the event takes place. Axios said that even if the event is successful, organizers are not planning to make it an in-person event in the future. The online-only event was designed to offer more access to the conversation than traditional in-person conferences generally provide.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In-person conferences tend to exclude those without financial means to travel or with geographic hurdles to attendance, those with time-prohibiting personal or professional commitments, those who have difficulty navigating crowds or in-person social interactions, and those who prefer to consume information at their own pace and in their choice of format,&#8221; Axios said. &#8220;Given the topic, it&#8217;s our aim that Design and Exclusion be as inclusive as it can while limiting its environmental impact.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Axios said one of the goals of the conference is to understand the industry&#8217;s failures in excluding people as a first step towards creating more inclusive products.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Design and Exclusion aims to do that as an honest and open dialogue with many representatives from across tech,&#8221; Axios said. &#8220;Success will be active participation in this event followed by the broader conversation around this topic from contributors beyond those involved in the initial discussion. To broadly measure success, we&#8217;ll look at views on the content, engagement online using #DesignX, and will track any increase in conversation by use of keywords associated with this topic.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Design and Exclusion kicks off at 9am PT / 12pm ET / 4pm UTC / 5pm GMT on April 21 and the <a href=\"https://x.design.blog/schedule/\" target=\"_blank\">schedule</a> has been published to the event&#8217;s website. Participants who want to join the discussion on making the web more inclusive are invited to use the #DesignX hashtag on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and other social networks.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 17 Apr 2017 22:04:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"WPTavern: Inuagural CabinPress Takes Place November 3-5, at Lake Louisa State Park in Clermont, FL\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68825\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"https://wptavern.com/inuagural-cabinpress-takes-place-november-3-5-at-lake-louisa-state-park-in-clermont-fl\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3050:\"<p>If spending time in the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/disconnect-from-technology-at-camp-press-september-23-24-in-seminole-ok\">woods in Oklahoma</a> to disconnect from technology is not your thing, perhaps staying at a cabin in Florida is. <a href=\"https://cabin.press/\">CabinPress</a>, organized by <a href=\"https://davidlaietta.com/\">David Laietta</a>, takes place November 3-5, at <a href=\"https://cabin.press/location/\">Lake Louisa State Park in Clermont, FL</a>.</p>\n<p>The location is about an hour&#8217;s drive from Orlando, FL and is 4,500 acres large with lakes, hills, and scenic areas.</p>\n<p>Similar to <a href=\"http://camp.press/\">CampPress</a>, CabinPress&#8217; goal is to disconnect people from technology to allow them to focus on building and strengthening personal relationships.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I enjoy camping and spending some time disconnected from technology, spending time with others,&#8221; Laietta said. &#8220;I get the most out of a conference when I have the opportunity to have deeper discussions with others than general &#8216;we&#8217;re crushing it, work is fine&#8217; chats.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is much more comfortable than camping though, so the focus can be on having fun and making connections, while still having a real bed and hot showers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Accommodations include fully furnished cabins with beds, air conditioning, kitchens, and bathrooms.

Many parents have a difficult time understanding the professions of their grown children, especially when they are in the tech industry. This can also be compounded by the novelty of remote work, which sometimes prompts questions like, &#8220;Just what is it that you do all day?&#8221; or &#8220;When are you going to get a real job?&#8221;</p>\n<p>The team at <a href=\"https://yoast.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Yoast</a> decided to be proactive about the problem of families not understanding their work by hosting an event called &#8220;Bring Your Parents to Work Day.&#8221; Yoast employs a team of nearly 50 people, with 40 employees working in a central office located in Wijchen, Netherlands, and 10 working remotely. The family event brought 42 parents to the office.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just awesome to have everyone&#8217;s &#8216;home&#8217; team understand what we do and relate to it,&#8221; CEO Joost de Valk said.</p>\n<p>Yoast Community Manager Taco Verdonschot brought his father to work today. His photo below shows all of the parents attending a presentation from Joost and Marieke de Valk about WordPress, open source, and Yoast&#8217;s products.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today is \'Bring your parents to work day\' at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yoast\">@yoast</a>. <br />Intended result: our parents finally understand what we really do! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/byptwd?src=hash\">#byptwd</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/WuhHlGhyeX\">pic.twitter.com/WuhHlGhyeX</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Taco Verdo (@TacoVerdo) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TacoVerdo/status/852866379309088768\">April 14, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>&#8220;Most parents didn’t know too much about WordPress and/or open source,&#8221; Verdonschot said. &#8220;They told the parents about our mission to make the web a better place for everyone and to make SEO available for everyone.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After the presentation Verdonschot said employees showed their parents around the office and Joost took them in small groups across the street to a second office the company will be opening soon.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We ended the Bring Your Parents to Work Day with drinks and snacks (home-made by my colleague Chris),&#8221; Verdonschot said. &#8220;Personally, I really liked meeting my colleagues’ parents. Some of them just look so much like their mom/dad! I really think that the presentation gave our parents a better understanding of what we do at Yoast, and how much we’re loving what we do.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The &#8220;Bring Your Parents to Work&#8221; event has been gaining popularity in the past two years. Many large companies participated in 2016, including LinkedIn, Dogfish Head Brewery, HubSpot, ASOS, and British Airways. Verdonschot hasn&#8217;t confirmed with the directors yet, but based on the success of today&#8217;s event, he expects Yoast will make this an annual event.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For me personally, I really like that my parents have visited the office and met my colleagues, because the world I work in now feels less strange for them,&#8221; Verdonschot said.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 14 Apr 2017 21:13:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"WPTavern: Free React Fundamentals Course Updated for React v15.5\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68772\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"https://wptavern.com/free-react-fundamentals-course-updated-for-react-v15-5\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2976:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/react-training.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for ways to expand your ReactJS knowledge, the free <a href=\"https://reacttraining.com/online/react-fundamentals\" target=\"_blank\">React Fundamentals</a> course from ReactTraining.com has been updated for the latest <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2017/04/07/react-v15.5.0.html\" target=\"_blank\">React v15.5</a> release. The 48-lesson course takes approximately 287 minutes to complete. It was designed for a wide range of professionals, including backend engineers new to JavaScript, Bootcamp graduates and front-end developers who want to expand their skill sets, and JavaScript developers coming from other frameworks.</p>\n<p>In the React Fundamentals course students will get an introduction to the React ecosystem and will learn how to set up a React component with NPM, Babel, and Webpack. The course covers topics like dataflow with Props, building UIs with Pure Functions, nesting React components, Stateless Functional Components, React Router V4, and more. Complete beginners may struggle, so the course author recommends students enter with a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. More than 57,000 students have taken React Fundamentals.</p>\n<p>Last year&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-javascript-survey-results-published-react-emerges-as-clear-winner-in-front-end-frameworks\" target=\"_blank\">State of JavaScript survey results</a> showed React as the clear winner among front-end frameworks in terms of developer interest and satisfaction.

The new widget interfaces with the WordPress media library to provide a simpler, more intuitive experience for adding images. No new widgets have been added to core since the Custom Menu widget was included in 3.0 nearly seven years ago.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloudup.com/cIod9B2PP1S\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/cldup.com/EtNHycj84H.gif?resize=1025%2C508&ssl=1\" alt=\"Image widget demo optimized\" /></a></p>\n<p>The current method of inserting images into widgets is a multi-step process that<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/image+widget/\" target=\"_blank\"> many plugins have attempted to simplify</a>. Hundreds of thousands of WordPress users have installed a plugin with this feature. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/image-widget/\" target=\"_blank\">Image Widget plugin</a>, created by Modern Tribe, is one of the most popular with more than 500,000 active installs.</p>\n<p>Widget architecture in WordPress currently relies on PHP and AJAX, but the new image widget will follow the recent trend towards JavaScript interfaces.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the time since WP_Widget was introduced in 2.8, WordPress has made dramatic shifts toward developing interfaces in JavaScript, including with the Customizer in 3.4 and the Media Library in 3.5, and more recently with the focus on the REST API,&#8221; contributors said in the proposal. &#8220;Given that the media widgets are naturally interfacing with the media library JS, it is necessary that the media widgets make use of JavaScript to construct their UI instead of relying on PHP.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Customizer component co-maintainer Weston Ruter noted in the comments that the new proposed image widget also allows for external images to be embedded by URL. This is a feature that Jetpack offers in its <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/extra-sidebar-widgets/image-widget/\" target=\"_blank\">image widget</a>. The new core widget will support both use cases that WordPress users are already familiar with from popular plugins.</p>\n<p>The image widget is the first of several planned JS-powered media widgets, including video, audio, galleries, and slideshows. Ruter said <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-core-media-widgets/pull/53\" target=\"_blank\">progress on the video widget</a> is coming along well and he anticipates it will likely land next. Contributors have begun work on the audio widget, but Ruter said galleries and slideshows are a higher priority.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg, who is leading core development this year, confirmed in his <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/04/13/first-quarter-check-in/\" target=\"_blank\">quarterly update</a> today that the image widget will be considered for 4.8.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The plan is for the larger block-driven customization work to kick off in June,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;Prior to that, we’re focusing on widgets and other low-hanging fruit. Lack of developers slowed us down the last few months, now doing better but could still use more help there.

Wordfence firewall and malware scanner products are in use on more than 2 million WordPress sites and the company estimates that 6.7% of all attacks on these sites are coming from hacked home routers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the past month alone we have seen over 57,000 unique home routers being used to attack WordPress sites,&#8221; Wordfence CEO Mark Maunder said. &#8220;Those home networks are now being explored by hackers who have full access to them via the hacked home router. They can access workstations, mobile devices, wifi cameras, wifi climate control and any other devices that use the home WiFi network.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Maunder said his team has mostly seen brute force attacks targeting both wp-login.php (the traditional login endpoint for WordPress) and also XMLRPC login. They have also seen a small percentage of complex attacks. Wordfence has detected a total of 67 million individual attacks from the routers the company identified in March.</p>\n<p>While Wordfence researchers were creating their <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/04/march-2017-wordpress-attack-report/\" target=\"_blank\">monthly attack report</a>, they noticed that Algeria had jumped in rankings from position 60 to 24 in thier “Top Attacking Countries” list. Their review of attack data in Algeria revealed a &#8216;long tail&#8217; of more than 10,000 attacking IPs originating from an Algerian state owned ISP.</p>\n<p>A vulnerability known as &#8220;<a href=\"http://mis.fortunecook.ie/\" target=\"_blank\">misfortune cookie</a>&#8221; is being used in these attacks. It hijacks a service that ISP&#8217;s use to remotely manage home routers by listening on port number 7547. ISP&#8217;s should close general internet access to this port, but many have not.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It appears that attackers have exploited home routers on Algeria’s state owned telecommunications network and are using the exploited routers to attack WordPress websites globally,&#8221; Maunder said.</p>\n<p>Wordfence researchers scanned the devices to find out what services they are running and found that they are Zyxel routers usually used in a home internet setting. They found that many of them have a severe and well-known vulnerability in RomPager, the embedded web server from AllegroSoft.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We then dug deeper and discovered that many ISPs around the world have this same issue and those routers are attacking WordPress sites via brute force attacks,&#8221; Maunder said.</p>\n<p>I spoke with Tony Perez, CEO of <a href=\"https://sucuri.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Sucuri</a> to see if his team has detected anything similar. Sucuri also tracks <a href=\"https://sucuri.net/security-reports/brute-force/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress brute force attempts</a>, but Perez said current numbers are not remarkable when compared historically to mid-2016.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the reason Sucuri and other companies are not seeing this is because it is a weak ranking signal for malicious behavior,&#8221; Maunder said. &#8220;As we point out in the <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/04/home-routers-attacking-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\">report</a>, each of these IPs is only doing between 50 and 1000 attacks per month on sites. They also only attack for a few hours each. These combined are a very weak ranking signal for malicious behavior. That low frequency also makes the attacks more effective because they are less likely to be blocked.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This particular security issue is unusual in that the vulnerability is with the routers, not with WordPress itself. The attackers bulk hack thousands of devices, upload a WordPress attack script and a list of targets, and then they have thousands of routers under their control to attack WordPress sites.</p>\n<p>This type of botnet isn&#8217;t terribly uncommon, as <a href=\"https://blog.eset.ie/2017/04/06/sathurbot-distributed-wordpress-password-attack/\" target=\"_blank\">security researchers from from ESET recently uncovered a new malware called Sathurbot</a> that uses torrent files as a method of distributing coordinated brute-force attacks on WordPress sites. The vulnerability in this instance is not in the software but rather in weak WordPress administrator accounts.</p>\n<p>Protecting against brute force attacks starts with a strong administrator password. There are also many popular plugins, such as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-simple-firewall/\" target=\"_blank\">Shield Security</a>, the <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/security-features/\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack Protect module</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-wp-security/\" target=\"_blank\">iThemes Security</a>, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/\" target=\"_blank\">Wordfence</a>, which offer protection from brute force attacks.</p>\n<p>If you want to make sure your router is not vulnerable to being recruited for these attacks, Wordfence has created a <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/04/check-your-router/\" target=\"_blank\">tool</a> that makes it easy to check. It detects whether your home router has port 7547 open or if it’s running a vulnerable version of RomPager. If you find that your router is vulnerable or port 7547 is open, Wordfence has published <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/04/check-your-router/\" target=\"_blank\">instructions for how to secure your device</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 13 Apr 2017 02:46:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"Matt: New Top 50 Restaurants\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=47210\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"https://ma.tt/2017/04/new-top-50-restaurants/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1012:\"<p>There&#8217;s a new <a href=\"http://www.theworlds50best.com/\">&#8220;World&#8217;s 50 Best Restaurants&#8221; list</a> out!

I was in secondary school and Internet was relatively new to Somalia. It arrived in 1998-99 but only very few people had internet in their homes. Luckily there were internet cafes and I was introduced to this guy who owned an internet cafe. He had a large collection of Somali music and wanted to upload to somewhere so he could share with other people. I put together a GeoCities website using Microsoft FrontPage.</p>\n<p>The site I built was literally a blank canvas with marquee at the top and links to the mp3 files.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The rest of the page was filled with animated gifs of waving flag, rotating globe and glittering stars.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I kept fiddling with FrontPage’s WYSIWYG tab. Every time I add new element to the visual tab I would immediately switch to the HTML tab and see how the generated code would look like. I have managed to teach myself some HTML this way, but I was still very uncomfortable with coding.</p>\n<h3>Buckling Down</h3>\n<p>After a while, I moved to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and suddenly I had plenty of time so I decided to buy a web design book. It was basically an HTML tutorial and it helped me code table-based layouts without using a visual builder. This led me to discover CSS, PHP and, among other things, WordPress.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I would install and test almost every PHP-based CMS out there: Mambo, Joomla, Drupal and few others but I settled with WordPress.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress was always user friendly and anyone with half-decent knowledge in HTML and CSS could open Kubrick (default theme until 2010) files in text editor and whip out something unique.</p>\n<h3>Leveling Up</h3>\n<p>It was around this time that I started to take freelance projects. My first WordPress project helped me buy a decent laptop, and suddenly other projects started to come. Most of my clients were people in Europe and United States.</p>\n<p>Getting paid was initially difficult. Most of international payment systems didn’t work in Somalia until very recently.</p>\n<blockquote><p>PayPal’s strict policy meant payment was one-way street: you can make payments but can’t receive or withdraw anything.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I managed to team up with someone in another country and we opened a shared account where we could receive the payments. My business partner would then transfer my slice to my local bank account. Things changed recently and although PayPal is still not an option, freelancers can get paid via international bank transfer or Payoneer.</p>\n<p>My experience with open source in general and WordPress in particular had positive impact in my life. I am quite lucky to wake up every morning and work, all on my own, in a country where <a href=\"http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/hdr/Somalia-human-development-report-2012.html\">54% of the population are unemployed and over 70% are youth</a>. This has prompted me to seek ways help other people to get into open source, creating hobbies and jobs for many young people who have a lot of time in their hands to learn, contribute and work with open source software.</p>\n<h3>Branching Out</h3>\n<p>Although the Internet keeps crushing physical borders and bureaucracy policies it doesn’t mean opportunities will magically come knocking on people’s doors. However, the advantage of investing in skills that allow the individual to go remote and tap a global market of design, development, copywriting or blogging, is that the individual is not dependent on the demand of the local market. Another advantage is that it helps the person connect to thousands of like-minded people from worldwide, whom you learn from and contribute to. It’s a bottomless world of possibilities.</p>\n<p>I have recently talked to few WordPress developers from different parts of Somalia and we were trying to figure out how we can organize a WordPress related event, preferably WordCamp Somalia. We didn’t set out time yet but it’s in our plans. Hopefully in 2018.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: A Bottomless World of Possibilities\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=A%20Bottomless%20World%20of%20Possibilities&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbottomless-world-possibilities%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: A Bottomless World of Possibilities\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbottomless-world-possibilities%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbottomless-world-possibilities%2F&title=A+Bottomless+World+of+Possibilities\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: A Bottomless World of Possibilities\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/bottomless-world-possibilities/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/041217-min-150x150.jpg&description=A Bottomless World of Possibilities\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: A Bottomless World of Possibilities\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/bottomless-world-possibilities/\" title=\"A Bottomless World of Possibilities\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/bottomless-world-possibilities/\">A Bottomless World of Possibilities</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 12 Apr 2017 12:00:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jamaal Jaamac\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"WPTavern: Advanced WordPress Facebook Group Moves to Curb Low Quality Content with Admin-Approved Posts\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68507\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:114:\"https://wptavern.com/advanced-wordpress-facebook-group-moves-to-curb-low-quality-content-with-admin-approved-posts\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5222:\"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Advanced-WordPress-Facebook-Group.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/\" target=\"_blank\">Advanced WordPress Facebook group</a> (AWP) is making a radical change. After three years of allowing members to post freely, the group&#8217;s administrators voted to restrict posting to admin-approved content only.</p>\n<p>The popular WordPress watering hole has amassed more than 28,000 members and plays host to many lively conversations. Over the years some have suggested the group switch to using a WordPress-powered site or forum, but Facebook&#8217;s infrastructure has proven to be a vital part of the community&#8217;s success. Most members are already tied into Facebook&#8217;s notification system for their personal accounts and posts receive much more exposure than if they were on a separate website.</p>\n<p>In more recent years, the group has struggled with a constant stream of low quality content, prompting admins to re-examine the group&#8217;s approach to posting.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our current mode of moderation is reactive,&#8221; AWP admin Matt Cromwell said. &#8220;Every time a low-quality post gets posted to the group it adds to the noise, and sometimes it might be hours and hours or even a day until an admin removes it — which means thousands of people have experienced the group with more &#8216;noise&#8217; than it should have. Our only tools in the current setup of the group is for that noise to be added automatically, and the admins having to clean it up after the fact.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cromwell said the group reached &#8220;a crisis moment&#8221; and several admins with experience in other large groups said content quality is much higher with admin-approved posts. The majority of the group&#8217;s 28 admins <a href=\"https://www.mattcromwell.com/awp-facebook-improving-content/\" target=\"_blank\">voted over the weekend to make the switch to admin-approved content only</a>. Cromwell said the vote breakdown included one abstention and six hesitant no votes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Some might think that is a lot more work for admins, but the truth is that we’ll actually be able to focus less on moderating in a reactive way, moderating profiles and negativity, and instead admin in a proactive way, moderating content,&#8221; Cromwell said.</p>\n<p>AJ Zane is one of the six admins who voted against the new rule. He said he sees AWP as an extension of the physical San Diego AWP group where he and other members enjoy open-table discussions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m voting ‘no’ because I think this group is about self moderation, open discussion, and letting the posts with good content bubble to the top,&#8221; Zane said. &#8220;If the physical AWP meetup was not a round table group of people sharing wins/bugs/discoveries/questions, but had curated presenters, I know I would not have been as excited to attend the sessions.

He proposed that the group build a forum website where they could use Facebook&#8217;s authentication and set up curated and free-post rooms, but said he sees it as &#8220;a nice pipe dream,&#8221; since few people would have time to build it.</p>\n<p>Members <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/1461487913913418/\" target=\"_blank\">responded positively to the news</a> that posting is changing, with a few exceptions who are worried about moderators having conflicts of interest. Others expressed concerns about not receiving timely posts and replies if someone is in need of assistance. Admins reminded members that the purpose of the group is not for receiving personalized support on projects.</p>\n<p>Several members commented on the announcement, saying they were considering quitting the group because the negative posts and noise level had gotten so high. Many are hopeful that fewer posts will generate more engagement on the content.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We also would like to starting hosting new kinds of content,&#8221; Cromwell said. &#8220;With admin-approved posts we can better facilitate an AMA, or a Facebook Live, or any other type of content.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cromwell said he expects there will be more work for admins in the first 4-8 weeks until members start to understand more intuitively what makes for a good post in the group.

The niche WordCamp will be open to anyone who uses WordPress to manage a publication, no matter what size. Organizers submitted an application last November and received approval from WordCamp Central in February.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A huge thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wordcamp\">@wordcamp</a> for letting us try this out. It\'s the first national WordCamp focused on a specific topic/industry.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Adam Schweigert (@aschweig) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aschweig/status/850040392812810241\">April 6, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>In previous planning stages, the event was going to be called &#8220;WordCamp for Journalists,&#8221; but WordCamp for Publishers is more inclusive of the different types of professionals who are involved in managing publications. Organizers are planning to have tracks with content for engineering, product, and editorial teams. Attendees will work together to collaborate on open source tools for publishers and best practices.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/crushgear\" target=\"_blank\">Steph Yiu</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aschweig\" target=\"_blank\">Adam Schweigert</a> are the lead organizers of the event. Schweigert used to run engineering at the Institute of Nonprofit News and also led a working group assembled by MIT and the Knight Foundation on CMS-related projects. Yiu was a part of that working group and most of the other 12 <a href=\"https://2017-denver.journalist.wordcamp.org/organizers/\" target=\"_blank\">organizers</a> came out of it. Others were found through a call for volunteers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a part of the working group we decided we wanted to pull together an event that was focused on WordPress, specifically helping improve the open source tools around publishing, and build a community around publishers that use WordPress,&#8221; Yiu said. &#8220;One thing that was very important to us was being able to reach smaller publishers, which is why, as part of the event, we are hoping to offer travel scholarships for folks who otherwise would not be able to attend.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After discussing a few different event types, Yiu said the team eventually settled on setting it up as a WordCamp because of the community and structure that WordCamp Central provides. However, unlike most WordCamps, the event will offer a mix of presentations and hands-on workshops. Organizers will soon open a call for both speakers and workshop facilitators.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s still early days for us since this is a first-time event,&#8221; Yiu said. &#8220;Our current goal is to have a mix of workshops aimed at people who contribute to the multiple areas of the publishing process (for example: developers, designers, product owners, and editorial staff) and multiple skill levels. We also hope to bring together people who maintain open source projects important to publishing to run workshops on both using and contributing with the goal of helping build up those projects for the long run.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordCamp for Publishers will be held at <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Denver Post</a>, a publication that runs on WordPress as a WordPress.com VIP customer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Mateo Leyba, who works at Digital First Media, was a part of the original working group and suggested they could sponsor with a venue donation,&#8221; Yiu said. &#8220;That was very welcome as venues are usually the most expensive part of any event! Also, it’s a cool spot with a beautiful view.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The call for speakers and workshop leaders will open soon and will close in early May. Tickets for the event will be $40 and will go on sale in May. As it&#8217;s the first event of its kind, the organizers are keeping it small and are limiting it to 230 attendees.

Both the editor and the customizer are included in Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s three main focus areas for core development in 2017. The purpose of the surveys is to find out how WordPress users are using or not using the current features.</p>\n<p>More than half of the survey respondents (66%) identified themselves as developers (in addition to other roles). Since this category of users dominated the survey results, Mark Uraine decided to break it down further to display other categories developers selected.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/non-dev-vs-dev.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Based on these results, it isn&#8217;t surprising that more than 85% of respondents use the markup text editor and 35% of those use it exclusively. Support for syntax highlighting is also a popular request.</p>\n<p>The distraction-free writing mode received quite a bit of feedback on the survey. More than 75% of respondents said they do not use it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/distraction-free.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The current implementation of the distraction-free writing mode was introduced in WordPress 4.1 at the end of 2014. The idea was to minimize distractions without having to go through a clunky transition to access the admin menu or meta boxes. Moving the cursor to the right or left of the editor brings them back into view, but many people find the admin interface sliding in and out of view to be distracting. Several who commented suggested that the feature could use some major improvements.</p>\n<p>The survey also revealed that the majority of respondents (72%) install plugins that add features to the editor. These most commonly include shortcodes, Advanced TinyMCE, Tables, and Visual Composer. The results indicate that users often extend the editor to get more basic advanced layout capabilities for presenting their content.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/popular-features.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The Editor Experience survey was a good first start, but it doesn&#8217;t accurately represent WordPress&#8217; global user base. The results are heavily skewed towards developers&#8217; needs and experiences. Developers are users, too, but there has to be a way to get these surveys into the hands of a more diverse sampling of users. Reopening the survey and circulating it beyond the WordPress developer community might help to paint a more accurate picture of users&#8217; experiences with the editor.</p>\n<p>A more diverse sampling would reveal whether or not the vast majority of users have no use for the current implementation of the distraction-free writing mode, as developer feedback seems to suggest. It could also provide more feedback on the visual editor features that 35% of respondents to this survey never use.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 10 Apr 2017 21:10:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"WPTavern: New Twitter Bot Automatically Tweets Links to Trac Tickets Tagged as Good-First-Bugs\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68613\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"https://wptavern.com/new-twitter-bot-automatically-tweets-links-to-trac-tickets-tagged-as-good-first-bugs\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2991:\"<p>In 2014, WordPress Trac <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-trac-gets-a-design-refresh-new-features-and-enhancements\">received a facelift</a> and one of the improvements was the “good-first-bug” tag.

than three weeks ago <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/yoast-seo-4-5-urges-users-to-upgrade-to-php-7\" target=\"_blank\">Yoast SEO version 4.5 was released</a> with an ugly, non-dismissible notice for sites on PHP 5.2. The notice encourages the user to upgrade to PHP 7, explaining that it is faster and more secure. It includes links for getting started and example emails that users can send to their hosting companies.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/whip-php-notice.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>In the 18 days since shipping the plugin with the upgrade nag, Yoast SEO creator Joost de Valk has seen a dramatic uptick in sites moving from old, unsupported versions to PHP 7. From December to March, PHP 5.2 usage among Yoast SEO users decreased from 1.9% to 1.7%, a modest drop over three months. After adding the nag on March 21, PHP 5.2 usage dropped from 1.7% to 1.3% for those using Yoast SEO version 4.5. PHP 5.3 usage is also steadily decreasing since de Valk began the campaign to educate his plugin&#8217;s users about the benefits of upgrading.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/yoast-stats.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>According to de Valk&#8217;s stats, 22.2% of Yoast SEO users are on version 4.5 of the plugin. He estimates 1,443,000 sites on 4.5 out of 6.5 million users.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Assuming 0.5% updated their PHP versions, that&#8217;s 7K sites,&#8221; de Valk said. &#8220;And another 14-20k that updated from 5.3 to something more decent.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Many developers are hesitant to implement a nag in their plugins, but Yoast SEO is one of the largest plugins to prove that an ugly, non-dismissible notice can be an effective tool for getting users to take action.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the reasons I’m sharing is because I’d love others to join us,&#8221; de Valk said. &#8220;People don&#8217;t like nags, but we&#8217;ve had some truly great feedback from users who went from PHP 5.2 to 7 and were astonished by how fast their sites suddenly were. Negative feedback has been absolutely minimal.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Yoast SEO team created a project called WHIP that makes it easy for plugin and theme developers to add notices that will nudge their users to upgrade their software versions, starting with PHP. The project also includes a filter for linking to the WordPress.org recommended hosting page, as an alternative to the Yoast.com hosting overview.</p>\n<p>De Valk said his team intends to push the notice to users on other PHP versions in the near future, starting with 5.3.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a release coming next week (4.6), in which we won&#8217;t do it yet,&#8221; de Valk said. &#8220;If all goes well and continues to be mellow, 5.3 will be &#8216;nagged&#8217; as of 4.7, probably three weeks later.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 08 Apr 2017 03:56:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"WPTavern: Recommended Reading: Resilient Web Design, a Free e-Book from Jeremy Keith\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68253\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"https://wptavern.com/recommended-reading-resilient-web-design-a-free-e-book-from-jeremy-keith\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5538:\"<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/typewriter.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/4OURRGDU7Z\">Sergey Zolkin</a>\n<p>UK-based web developer <a href=\"https://adactio.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jeremy Keith</a> published <a href=\"https://resilientwebdesign.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Resilient Web Design</a> as a free e-book in December 2016. Over the past few months, industry leaders have been raving about the book, so I decided to take an evening to find out what all the fuss is about. Keith has been blogging for more than 15 years at <a href=\"http://adactio.com\" target=\"_blank\">adactio.com</a>. He is an active contributor to the web standards movement, a popular conference speaker, and the author of <em>DOM Scripting</em>, <em>Bulletproof Ajax</em>, and <em>HTML5 For Web Designers</em>.</p>\n<p>After just a few pages in, I could see why so many have read Resilient Web Design all in one go. It lives up to all the excellent reviews. The book is divided into seven chapters and can be read in a couple hours. It is not a book on best practices, as one might expect, but rather a historical perspective on web standards and the evolution of responsive design. It provides a foundation for understanding technological progress and is essentially a primer on how breakthrough ideas happen and how resilient ideas endure.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The World Wide Web has been around for long enough now that we can begin to evaluate the twists and turns of its evolution,&#8221; Keith said. &#8220;I wrote this book to highlight some of the approaches to web design that have proven to be resilient. I didn’t do this purely out of historical interest (although I am fascinated by the already rich history of our young industry). In learning from the past, I believe we can better prepare for the future.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Keith&#8217;s brief history of web design recaptures some of the magic we felt at the dawn of the web. He said much of the subject matter has been included in his conference talks over the past couple of years but the book ended up taking some twists and turns that surprised him.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You won’t find any code in here to help you build better websites,&#8221; Keith said. &#8220;But you will find ideas and approaches. Ideas are more resilient than code. I’ve tried to combine the most resilient ideas from the history of web design into an approach for building the websites of the future.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Keith shares some thought-provoking ideas on design in chapter 3 that are particularly applicable to WordPress&#8217; <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2016-mullenweg-pushes-calypso-as-future-of-wordpress-interface-proposes-major-changes-to-release-cycle\" target=\"_blank\">new structure for releases where design and user testing will lead the way</a> in building a new editing and customization experience. The closest thing you can have to predicting the future is an understanding of what has endured in the past and an idea for building on it. Keith&#8217;s book examines principles that have proven to be resilient over time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Design adds clarity,&#8221; Keith said. &#8220;Using colour, typography, hierarchy, contrast, and all the other tools at their disposal, designers can take an unordered jumble of information and turn it into something that’s easy to use and pleasurable to behold. Like life itself, design can win a small victory against the entropy of the universe, creating pockets of order from the raw materials of chaos.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Keith said he wrote Resilient Web Design for people who create websites in any capacity.

We don&#8217;t know what the web will become, but Keith&#8217;s perspective on its history brings a few resilient ideas to light. If you have some spare time over the weekend and want to be inspired about the future of the web, I highly recommend reading Resilient Web Design.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 07 Apr 2017 20:29:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"WPTavern: New Userscript Restores Tabs to the WordPress Plugin Directory\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68488\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"https://wptavern.com/new-userscript-restores-tabs-to-the-wordpress-plugin-directory\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2745:\"<p>One of the most common complaints about the WordPress plugin directory&#8217;s redesign is the use of read more links instead of tabs. Plugin authors and users <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-redesign-why-so-many-people-feel-their-feedback-was-ignored#comment-217002\">contend</a> that tabs make information more accessible. The redesign requires visitors to scroll a one-page design and click on various read more links to discover more information.</p>\n<p>There is a <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2278\">ticket on Trac</a> that suggests a jump section be included so that visitors can jump to specific sections of a plugin&#8217;s readme file. It&#8217;s unclear if this feature will be added but if you&#8217;d like to restore the tabbed layout to the plugin directory, check out <a href=\"https://openuserjs.org/scripts/nextgenthemes/Wordpress.org_Plugin_Directory_Tabs\">this Userscript</a> created by Nicolas Jonas.</p>\n<p>According <a href=\"https://openuserjs.org/about/Userscript-Beginners-HOWTO\">to OpenUserJS</a>, userscripts are open source add-ons for browsers that can modify webpages as they&#8217;re loaded. Using userscripts is roughly the same as installing WordPress plugins to restore lost functionality. Jonas&#8217; userscript <a href=\"https://openuserjs.org/scripts/nextgenthemes/Wordpress.org_Plugin_Directory_Tabs/source\">source code</a> contains a mix of CSS and jQuery to generate the tabs.</p>\n<p>To install the <a href=\"https://openuserjs.org/scripts/nextgenthemes/Wordpress.org_Plugin_Directory_Tabs/issues\">WordPress.org Plugin Directory Tabs</a> userscript in Firefox, you&#8217;ll first need to install the free <a href=\"https://openuserjs.org/about/Greasemonkey-for-Firefox\">Greasemonkey extension</a>. Greasemonkey is a Mozilla Add-on for Firefox that allows userscripts to run in the browser.</p>\n<img />Greasemonkey Firefox Add-on\n<p>Jonas developed the userscript in about 30 minutes and used CSS from a CSS button generator. The tabs have a blue background with white text on top. Jonas is open to suggestions and encourages those who want better designed buttons to <a href=\"https://openuserjs.org/scripts/nextgenthemes/Wordpress.org_Plugin_Directory_Tabs/issues\">create an issue</a> with the proper CSS code on his OpenUserJS page.</p>\n<img />Tabbed Layout\n<p>I tested the userscript on Firefox 52.0.2 and didn&#8217;t encounter any issues. After navigating the plugin directory with tabs, I can easily say I prefer it versus clicking read more links. I rarely have to scroll and the information I want to see is displayed front and center. Simply put, browsing a plugin&#8217;s page with tabs is a better user experience.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 07 Apr 2017 02:25:02 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"WPTavern: WordPress Plugin Directory Restores Stats and Links to Older Versions of Plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68486\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-restores-stats-and-links-to-older-versions-of-plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2353:\"<p>Since the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-relaunches-plugin-directory-with-new-design-and-improved-search-algorithm\">launch</a> of the newly redesigned WordPress plugin directory, the Meta team has been hard at work fixing bugs and updating the design.

That&#8217;s what <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B01N1O4M4G\" target=\"_blank\">Blog Helper</a>, an Alexa skill, enables for WordPress.com and self-hosted Jetpack users. It is available for free in Amazon&#8217;s catalog of Alexa skills.</p>\n<p>Automattic developer <a href=\"https://www.chrisfinke.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Christopher Finke</a> created the Alexa integration for WordPress after purchasing an Echo and some Dots for his house and experimenting with different ways for making them useful. He programmed Blog Helper to allow users to check WordPress.com notifications, moderate pending comments, and save blog post ideas as drafts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-27-at-10.17.11-PM-e1490671125329.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Blog Helper relies on WordPress.com&#8217;s OAuth support, which Finke said self-hosted sites can get via Jetpack. After asking Alexa to enable Blog Helper, you will need to link your WordPress.com account and select the blog you want to access. Once you&#8217;re hooked up, you can say, &#8220;Alexa, ask Blog Helper for my notifications.&#8221; Alexa will read off new notifications one-by-one and mark them as read.</p>\n<p>Blog Helper also enables comment moderation with your voice, so you can take care of that while folding the laundry or doing dishes. If you ask, &#8220;Do I have any comments to moderate?&#8221;, Alexa will read them to you and you can approve, delete, or mark them as spam. Check out the quick demo video Finke created to hear it in action:</p>\n<div class=\"embed-wrap\"></div>\n<p>Scientific studies have proven that <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/why-great-ideas-always-come-in-the-shower-and-how-to-h-1617303016\" target=\"_blank\">some of your best ideas come to you when your mind is relaxed and your body is distracted by routine tasks</a>. If you have an Alexa-enabled device, Blog Helper is a fun way to help you capture your creative ideas in WordPress before they get away. It allows you to create new drafts without having to pick up your phone or sit down to your desktop.</p>\n<p>Although Finke works for Automattic, he wrote Blog Helper in his free time and it doesn&#8217;t have any official affiliation with WordPress.com. His said his roadmap is to try and make as much of the core WordPress experience accessible by voice as possible. Blog Helper can be a big time-saver for those who want to manage their blogs without being tied down to a screen, but the voice interface can also be useful for those who have vision impairments. Blog Helper is GPL-licensed and <a href=\"https://github.com/cfinke/Blog-Helper\" target=\"_blank\">available on GitHub</a> if you want to contribute or follow for updates.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 06 Apr 2017 02:04:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"WPTavern: Jetpack 4.8 Introduces Settings Redesign, Adds Global WordPress.com Toolbar\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68255\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-4-8-introduces-settings-redesign-adds-global-wordpress-com-toolbar\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3338:\"<p><a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2017/04/04/settings-overhaul-redesign/\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack 4.8</a> was released this week with a settings redesign that is a continuation of the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-4-3-released-features-new-react-js-powered-admin-interface\" target=\"_blank\">React.js-powered admin interface introduced last September</a>. The new settings screen has been completely rearranged under a more simplified menu.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We went through every setting on WordPress.com and Jetpack to make sure it was necessary to keep around, and to find a good, logical home for each one,&#8221; Jetpack designer Michael Arestad said. &#8220;We ended up mirroring the WordPress core settings groups for now — they are familiar to people, and things fit well there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Arestad said he was inspired by the way mobile devices handle settings, especially how they rarely include a &#8220;Save&#8221; button unless it&#8217;s an option that isn&#8217;t a simple toggle. The Jetpack design team applied this to the settings screens so that most of them are now autosaved.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/autosave.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release also introduces the ability to enable the WordPress.com Toolbar, a new feature that replaces the wp-admin toolbar with the My Sites menu, a link to the WordPress.com reader, a Write button that takes you to WordPress.com, and a notifications dropdown. It is essentially the same toolbar you see when working with a WordPress.com site.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jetpack-wp-com-toolbar.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Jetpack 4.8 includes several dozen improvements and bug fixes. A few of the highlights include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New MailChimp Subscribe Popup widget</li>\n<li>Sitemaps are faster and now support sites with a very large number of posts (1,000+)</li>\n<li>Contact Form now has a plain-text alternative and better avoids spam filters</li>\n<li>Debug form includes extra information to better prioritize support requests</li>\n<li>Photon can now be used within the dashboard and supports bbPress topics and replies</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Jetpack 4.8.1 Fixes PHP Incompatibility Issue</h3>\n<p>Many users reported fatal errors and blank pages after updating to Jetpack 4.8. A temporary fix was to load an older version of Jetpack. In a convenient turn of events, the WordPress plugin directory restored the ability to download older versions of plugins today (found under the new Advanced View link).</p>\n<p>Jetpack 4.8 included PHP code that is incompatible with PHP versions lower than 5.4, which caused the fatal errors. The Sitemaps module also included an incompatibility with the WP Rocket plugin. Additionally, the release included many new translation files, which caused updates not to complete on sites that have limited resources for processing large files on updates.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2017/04/05/jetpack-4-8-1-php-version-incompatibility-fix/\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack 4.8.1</a> was released a few hours ago to correct these issues. The Jetpack development team recommends manually installing the plugin via FTP/SFTP if your site crashed and you are unable to update through the admin.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:07:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"HeroPress: WordPress Flexibility\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1680\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-flexibility/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5214:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/040517-min-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: WordPress gives me all the flexibility I need to be constantly learning and improving.\" /><p>When I was asked to describe myself and my interests for a bio at work I floundered. I felt the same way when sitting down to write this. Where do I even begin? For my bio, I decided instead of narrowing it down I’d go with “jill-of-all-trades.” I really like to do everything and if I don’t like something I only know that because I tried it first. I’ve been this way since I can remember. At school I got good grades in everything (except Chemistry), I liked everything (except Chemistry) and I wanted to do everything. Figuring out my career path was therefore a long process (I actually started out pre-med in college, but you know&#8230; Chemistry).</p>\n<p>After graduating college I started working in marketing and absolutely hated it &#8211; I did the same exact thing almost every day. It was miserable. I missed the old web content job I had during college, where I did SEO, product photography, email campaigns, basically anything website related. Right now I can’t believe there was a point in my life that I missed HTML emails, but I did. I missed the flexibility, doing something different every day, and most importantly, I missed the creative problem solving it entailed.</p>\n<blockquote><p>So I quit my stupid marketing job and attended a coding bootcamp.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It was a Front End Development track where I honed my HTML and CSS skills, learned JavaScript in a few forms (vanilla, jQuery, AngularJS), and learned other tools of the trade (git, task runners, bash, etc.). When I landed my first web development job I was excited &#8211; the company did all sorts of different projects: web apps, web sites, intranets, you name it. I knew that there was enough variety to keep me constantly moving and constantly learning. My first project was something I was familiar with, an AngularJS application, but my second project was something I’d never seen before &#8211; a WordPress site. Knowing zero PHP, I dove right in.</p>\n<p>I can’t say that I loved WordPress right off the bat. When I was still mostly developing pretty simple sites with it, I was afraid it was going to become monotonous. Today I know how wrong I was. Although the majority of the projects I work with involve WordPress, I can do something new and different with every site.</p>\n<p>Just this year I’ve worked on a WordPress theme with a headless React front end, a WordPress site with part of the admin area written in React, and a WordPress plugin with a front end built in Angular 2. Even traditional WordPress themes can be exciting. Each client has their own needs and with the flexibility of templates, post types, and widgets every site I build is a new challenge.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’ve come a long way since drowning in monotony early in my career.</p></blockquote>\n<p>At home you might find me doing yard work, refinishing furniture, knitting, wood burning, or attempting to play the banjo. But at work, using WordPress gives me all the flexibility I need to be constantly learning and improving.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: WordPress Flexibility\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=WordPress%20Flexibility&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwordpress-flexibility%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: WordPress Flexibility\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwordpress-flexibility%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwordpress-flexibility%2F&title=WordPress+Flexibility\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: WordPress Flexibility\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-flexibility/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/040517-min-150x150.jpg&description=WordPress Flexibility\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: WordPress Flexibility\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-flexibility/\" title=\"WordPress Flexibility\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-flexibility/\">WordPress Flexibility</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Apr 2017 12:00:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Natalie Miller\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:109:\"WPTavern: WooCommerce 3.0 Brings Major Improvements to Product Gallery, Introduces CRUD Classes and a New CLI\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68232\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:119:\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-3-0-brings-major-improvements-to-product-gallery-introduces-crud-classes-and-a-new-cli\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4330:\"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/woocommerce-3-0.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/2017/04/woocommerce-3-0-release/\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce 3.0</a> “Bionic Butterfly” was released today with significant improvements to the product gallery and developer tools. This version, which was previously going to be <a href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2017/03/13/important-update-regarding-the-upcoming-woocommerce-release-2-7-will-be-3-0-0/\" target=\"_blank\">2.7</a>, is the first major release since the plugin <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-3-0-0-scheduled-for-release-april-4th\" target=\"_blank\">switched to semantic versioning</a>. It was released after more than three months in beta and an extended RC testing period that allowed extension and theme developers enough time to get up to speed.</p>\n<p>The new product gallery has subtle improvements for galleries with multiple images. Clicking on a thumbnail updates the image without forcing it to open in a popup window. Galleries in 3.0 are also more intuitive on mobile with support for touch gestures, including swipe to scroll through the gallery, pinch to zoom, and swipe up to close the current image. These and several bug fixes and improvements deliver a much smoother experience of viewing product images.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-wrap\"></div>\n<p>This release includes significant performance improvements, thanks to the switch from post meta to taxonomies for features like product visibility, featured products, and out of stock products. WooCommerce contributors have also reduced the number of queries required to display related products and upsells.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2016/10/27/the-new-crud-classes-in-woocommerce-2-7/\" target=\"_blank\">Version 3.0 introduces CRUD</a> (Create, Read, Update, Delete) classes for developers, making it easier to write and retrieve data from the database with less code.</p>\n<p>&#8220;High order volume is one of the best problems a store can have, but it can really slow down your site’s performance,&#8221; WooCommerce lead developer Mike Jolley said. &#8220;That’s why our team’s main focus this year is performance and scalability.&#8221; Scalability improvements are planned for the next several releases.</p>\n<p>Version 3.0 also <a href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2016/12/12/2-7-a-new-cli-for-woocommerce/\" target=\"_blank\">introduces a new command line interface (CLI)</a> powered by the REST API. The previous CLI didn&#8217;t fully support the same functionality and was powered by its own separate code. The new CLI forks <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-cli/restful\" target=\"_blank\">Restful</a> to make REST API endpoints available as WP-CLI commands. It reduces the amount of code that WooCommerce has to maintain and ensures that the commands are always current as the project&#8217;s REST API is updated in the future.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce/\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce support forums on WordPress.org</a> have been lighting up with requests after 3.0 was released. One particular issue pinned to the top of the forums is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/3-0-error-option-ajax-is-not-allowed-for-select2/\" target=\"_blank\">an incompatibility with Select2 v3</a>. The latest version of WooCommerce uses Select2 V4 and this may cause an issue with AJAX search inputs in plugins and themes loading an older version of Select2.</p>\n<p>Another issue users are having after upgrade is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/3-0-frontend-pages-refreshing/\" target=\"_blank\">frontend pages reloading endlessly</a>, which WooCommerce developers have identified as a problem with the geolocation setting. They are working on a fix for 3.0.1.</p>\n<p>Many users who are reporting issues after updating to 3.0 have discovered incompatibilities with themes or plugins. This release received more than 3,000 commits from 115 contributors. With this many changes packed into a major release, WooCommerce developers recommend testing on a staging site and making a backup before updating the plugin. This will give you the opportunity to make sure your theme and plugins are compatible with the update.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Apr 2017 01:56:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: Disconnect From Technology at Camp Press September 23-24 in Seminole, OK\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68248\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://wptavern.com/disconnect-from-technology-at-camp-press-september-23-24-in-seminole-ok\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4477:\"<p>Readers may remember in 2015, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/camppress-a-2-3-day-social-experience-for-geeks-and-creatives\">we highlighted</a> Camp Press, a conference devoted to disconnecting from technology to focus on strengthening bonds that encourage collaboration within the community.</p>\n<p>Mendel Kurland, who has spent the better part of two years organizing the event, <a href=\"https://camp.press/\">announced</a> that Camp Press will take place September 23-24, at Fry Lake in Seminole, OK. The event is a collaboration between Kurland, Aaron D. Campbell, and Christen Campbell</p>\n<p>Accommodations include tents, cabins, and RV hookups.

Camp Press is about fortifying those in-person bonds.&#8221;</span></span></p>\n<p>Kurland chose to host the event at Camp Campbell based on its size, number of available activities, and its remoteness.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s centrally located in the US, and remote enough to achieve the goal of disconnection. Additionally, Aaron&#8217;s family is pretty great too as it&#8217;s their land.&#8221;</p>\n<p><span id=\"cch_fae57e021243ee\" class=\"_mh6 _wsc\"><span class=\"_3oh- _58nk\">The nearest major airport is an hour away in Oklahoma City so renting a vehicle is recommended. Alternatively, attendees can coordinate rides through the #camp-press-rides channel on the Geek Adventures Slack team. Invitations to join the Slack group are emailed after <a href=\"https://camp.press/register/\">registering for the event</a>.</span></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"cch_fae57e021243ee\" class=\"_mh6 _wsc\"><span class=\"_3oh- _58nk\">There is internet connectivity on the property, but it&#8217;s for emergencies and can only be used by staff. There are places in and around the Camp Press area for those who need to check-in with family.</span></span></p>\n<p>General admission tickets to attend the event are $100 each but if you purchase them before April 14th, they&#8217;re $85. There are also tickets available for reserved cabins for 10 people, a shared cabin, and RV hookups.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>General admission tickets include the following amenities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Free tent camping</li>\n<li>Other camping options with add-on (if available)</li>\n<li>Full Camp Press event + service day (starting Thursday)</li>\n<li>Event t-shirt</li>\n<li>Cooking utensils</li>\n<li>Fire starting supplies</li>\n<li>Field and water activities</li>\n<li>Arts and crafts supplies</li>\n<li>Daily ice service</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Kurland wants the event to maintain a brand-free feeling and is asking for sponsors to adhere to a set of <a href=\"https://camp.press/sponsors/\">atypical guidelines</a>. The guidelines state that sponsors may not wear branded gear and that advertising must be hand-made on-site.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We realize these guidelines aren’t for everyone, but we’re looking for creativity rather than corporate branding for these sponsorships,&#8221; Kurland said.</p>\n<p>Sponsorship levels range from $1,500 to $3,000 and offer various perks.</p>\n<p>Those interested in attending are encouraged to review the event&#8217;s <a href=\"https://camp.press/code-of-conduct/\">Code of Conduct,</a> which is unique compared to an event held in a physical building. For example, it has a guideline for leaving no trace:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our community respects the environment. We are committed to leaving no physical trace of our activities wherever we gather. We clean up after ourselves and endeavor, whenever possible, to leave such places in a better state than when we found them.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You don&#8217;t have to be involved with WordPress to attend the event. For more information and to purchase tickets, visit the <a href=\"https://camp.press/\">official Camp Press site</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 04 Apr 2017 20:32:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"WPTavern: WP-CLI Names Alain Schlesser New Co-Maintainer\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68228\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wptavern.com/wp-cli-names-alain-schlesser-new-co-maintainer\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5640:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/wp-cli.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>WP-CLI has hired <a href=\"https://www.alainschlesser.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Alain Schlesser</a> as a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/2017/04/03/new-co-maintainer-alain-thanks-2017-sponsors/\" target=\"_blank\">new part-time co-maintainer</a>. The position was made possible by sponsorships from Automattic, Bluehost, DreamHost, SiteGround, WP Engine, and more than 60 individuals who contributed to the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With Alain joining the project as a co-maintainer, the WP-CLI project is restoring capacity to meet current demands (e.g. support), and ramping up on new feature development and evangelization,&#8221; WP-CLI co-maintainer Daniel Bachhuber said. &#8220;We’ve already improved the build time by 33%!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Schlesser first became involved in the project after Bachhuber contacted him last March for input on solving some outstanding issues with Composer, which WP-CLI uses for external package management. Schlesser said he couldn&#8217;t afford the time to actively work on the issue at that time but tried to offer meaningful input for the right angle for solving the remaining issues.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This short collaboration changed my perception about WP-CLI and helped me realize that there is a push to use modern and modular code to improve the tool and prepare it for future requirements,&#8221; Schlesser said. &#8220;So, already at that point, I wanted to contribute to the project. However, I was already involved in a different part of WordPress contribution (which is now the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/02/22/nextgen-bootstrap/\" target=\"_blank\">Nextgen Bootstrap/Load Feature Project</a>), and I had to prioritize my volunteer work and keep a few hours left for paid client work as well.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Schlesser said taking on the role of a maintainer became an option once it was a paid position made possible by the project&#8217;s 2017 sponsors. Prior to that he would not have been able to financially afford the additional time investment that WP-CLI requires. The new role enables him to work for 5-10 hours per week on general user support, development of new and improved features, writing documentation, managing the issue backlog, reviewing pull requests and working on the project&#8217;s infrastructure.</p>\n<p>In joining WP-CLI as a co-maintainer, Schlesser brings a fresh perspective from developing for other platforms and years experience managing and contributing to <a href=\"https://www.alainschlesser.com/community/\" target=\"_blank\">dozens of open source projects</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WP-CLI is in a unique place in terms of what it tries to achieve and how it does it (out of necessity),&#8221; Schlesser said. &#8220;For most other web platforms, the command line interface is a regular part of the core of the system itself, often building what is known as a <a href=\"http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture\" target=\"_blank\">Hexagonal Architecture</a>. WP-CLI, on the other hand, achieves most of the same benefits even though it has no direct control over the Core source code, and that source code is not meant to support such an architecture. Given the obstacles, the current results are quite an achievement!&#8221;</p>\n<p>After its 1.0.0 release, WP-CLI <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-cli-1-1-0-released-project-shifts-to-expand-package-index\" target=\"_blank\">shifted to focus on its package ecosystem</a>. New features are now built as standalone packages instead of rolling everything into WP-CLI core. The eventual goal is to better distribute the project&#8217;s maintenance burden among package maintainers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the most important change in the upcoming release is that all the bundled commands have been extracted into separate packages, and we&#8217;re currently in the process of getting rid of all the issues that this move has uncovered,&#8221; Schlesser said. &#8220;So, when it comes to making WP-CLI easily extensible and improving the tools and interfaces, we&#8217;re now eating our own dog food. In the longer term, I expect this change to have a significant impact on the onboarding experience for developers who want to create their own commands.&#8221;</p>\n<p>During his years contributing to open source projects, Schlesser said he has become well-acquainted with the unique challenges and emotional toll of maintainership, a topic that <a href=\"https://danielbachhuber.com/2016/06/26/my-condolences-youre-now-the-maintainer-of-a-popular-open-source-project/\" target=\"_blank\">Bachhuber has spoken about in the past</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Maintenance of a popular open source project is at the intersection of the hard logic of technology and deeply human group dynamics,&#8221; Schlesser said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve become more aware of all the difficulties that come with such a role, but I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily state that I know anything more now on how to navigate around them. What I know for sure is that it is a burden that should be shared amongst several people when at all possible. It comes with constant pressure and churn, and doing this work as a single person puts both the project and the person at risk.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Schlesser plans to keep an eye out for any avoidable friction points in hopes of making the experience of maintainership as smooth as possible for all involved.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Daniel has already done a great job with this, and I can&#8217;t wait to see where the project will take us as a team,&#8221; Schlesser said.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 04 Apr 2017 17:19:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"BuddyPress: 2016 BuddyPress Survey Results\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=265117\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://buddypress.org/2017/04/2016-buddypress-survey-results/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18896:\"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-265189\" src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2017/04/bp-countries-2016.png\" alt=\"61 country flags of survey participants\" width=\"765\" height=\"490\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Thank you!</h2>\n<p>This report presents the results from the 2016 BuddyPress Survey held from November 1 through December 31, 2016. Three hundred and two (302) respondents from 61 countries completed the survey and provided valuable and interesting feedback. Many thanks!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Survey Design/Method</h2>\n<p>The survey contained 36 questions geared towards <a href=\"https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2016/07/13/priorities-for-the-next-12-months/\">Site Builders and WordPress Developers</a>. Adjusting to this more focused target audience compared to previous years&#8217;, I selected some questions from our BuddyPress <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/2013/09/2013-buddypress-codex-survey-results/\">2013</a>, <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/2014/03/2014-buddypress-survey-results/\">2014</a> and <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/2015/05/2015-buddypress-survey-results/\">2015</a> Surveys, combined/split/modified some of the questions, and added 15 new questions. The survey was designed to maximize responses and get snapshots of:<br />\n&#8211; basic demographic information<br />\n&#8211; versions of WordPress, BuddyPress, bbPress, and PHP used<br />\n&#8211; the types, languages, number of members in BP sites<br />\n&#8211; comfort levels with BuddyPress, BP theme compatibility, and BP Hooks<br />\n&#8211; development practices and tools<br />\n&#8211; respondents willing to share their BP use cases<br />\n&#8211; BuddyPress participation and contributions<br />\n&#8211; comments about BuddyPress, BP theme/plugin development, and the survey.</p>\n<p>The questionnaire was finalized after incorporating the feedback on the draft from the BP Lead/Core Developers last year. The survey was then promoted via Twitter, BP support forums, bpdevel.wordpress.com, and survey banners added by <a class=\"bp-suggestions-mention\" href=\"https://buddypress.org/members/johnjamesjacoby/\" rel=\"nofollow\">@johnjamesjacoby</a> at https://buddypress.org and https://codex.buddypress.org which helped a lot.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Key Findings</h2>\n<p>This section shows some of the highlights from the survey with short comments about each.

The Raspberry Pi Foundation <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ten-millionth-raspberry-pi-new-kit/\" target=\"_blank\">sold its ten millionth Pi</a> last year and just released the Pi Zero W in February 2017 with built-in WiFi and Bluetooth.</p>\n<p>If you are among the millions of Raspberry Pi owners who like to tinker with software, check out Automattic&#8217;s new <a href=\"https://inabox.blog/\" target=\"_blank\">Blog in a Box</a> project. It currently offers the easiest way of installing WordPress onto a Raspberry Pi.</p>\n<p>Although RaspberryPi.org has documentation for <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/lamp-web-server-with-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\">how to run WordPress as a local website on your Raspberry Pi</a>, its recommended method requires you to install and configure Apache, PHP, and MySQL to create a LAMP web server.</p>\n<p>Blog in a Box makes it simpler with a GUI <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/biab-installer\" target=\"_blank\">installer</a> that puts everything you need for installing WordPress onto an SD card. It comes bundled with PHP7, Nginx, and the latest version of WordPress. It automatically installs the <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/biab-plugin\" target=\"_blank\">Blog In A Box WordPress plugin</a>, which provides an interface for the Blog In A Box CLI tool and widgets for SenseHAT readings. It also includes a full Node development environment. The project&#8217;s creators call it &#8220;a complete system for interfacing Pi hardware with WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Blog in a Box enables users to publish data captured by the Raspberry Pi camera and SenseHAT, like photos or temperature readings, to a WordPress site that can be accessed on your local network at bloginabox.local. It is not yet capable of publishing to the web, but John Godley, an Automattic developer who worked on the project, said the team is open to adding this.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Part of the fun of a Pi is having this device in front of you that you can play and experiment with, and we wanted to have WordPress running right there inside the Pi too &#8211; it really is a blog in a box!&#8221; Godley said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We hope that having it local will encourage people to tinker with WordPress and use it to learn programming, or to run experiments in classrooms.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There are currently no live examples of blogs on the web that are receiving posts from a Raspberry Pi. However, fellow Automattic developer and Pi enthusiast Nick Momrik has created a device called <a href=\"https://nick.blog/2017/03/14/blog-in-a-box-paparazzi/\" target=\"_blank\">Blog in a Box Paparazzi</a> that extends the project with additional sensors to take a photo when anyone walks past it. His circuit diagram and a full list of sensors and other electronic components are available on <a href=\"https://github.com/nickmomrik/biab-paparazzi\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>. It&#8217;s one example of how Blog in a Box can be used as a base for other fun use cases.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/paparazzi-fritzing.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>image credit: Nick Momrik &#8211; <a href=\"https://github.com/nickmomrik/biab-paparazzi\">Blog in a Box Paparazzi GitHub repo</a>\n<p>Although the project doesn&#8217;t come packaged with functionality that would allow it to work as a livecam, Godley said it&#8217;s certainly a possibility.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We created a system to make it easy to interface the Pi hardware with WordPress &#8211; there&#8217;s a plugin and a set of server tools that are all extensible,&#8221; Godley said. &#8220;With a bit of work a livecam system could be added. If you add the sensor mentioned above you could livestream your cat whenever it’s nearby. Add some different sensors and you can see what affects a plant’s growth in a biology experiment and have the data ready to be viewed through WordPress, add a touchscreen and you have an interactive WordPress-powered display.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Since the system uses the REST API internally, Godley it wouldn&#8217;t be difficult to configure it to send data to a remote WordPress site. The team has looked at the possibility of doing this and may revisit it in the future if there&#8217;s enough interest.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Making it really easy to set up was a primary aim &#8211; we didn’t want people to have to setup MySQL and web servers and all the complexities involved in connecting this to Pi sensors. Just a few clicks and a fully working system is copied to an SD card,&#8221; Godley said. &#8220;Once you boot your Pi it appears on your local network and can be used immediately.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The site runs on the local network but the box ensures that WordPress and its plugins stay updated. The ability to run the box without an internet connection is one of the main advantages of Blog in a Box.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The fact you can run it without an internet connection means it can be used in situations where a remote WordPress may not be appropriate &#8212; in your home, in schools, etc,&#8221; Godley said. &#8220;If someone <a href=\"https://astro-pi.org/\" target=\"_blank\">sends WordPress into space on a rocket</a>, then we’d love to hear about it!&#8221;</p>\n<p>The project is an exciting example of how WordPress can be deeply integrated with various hardware components to automatically capture and publish environmental data in a way that&#8217;s easy to view. Godley and his team at Automattic hope that <a href=\"https://inabox.blog/\" target=\"_blank\">Blog in a Box</a> will put WordPress into the hands of more like-minded tinkerers. The entire project, including the <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/biab-installer\" target=\"_blank\">installer</a>, the companion WordPress <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/biab-theme\" target=\"_blank\">theme</a>, and the <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/biab-plugin\" target=\"_blank\">plugin</a>, are all open source.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As well as people connecting the real world to their Pi, we hope that just having a full web development environment ready to go will encourage people to tinker with WordPress and try out programming or theming,&#8221; Godley said.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 03 Apr 2017 21:34:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"HeroPress: HeroPress Geography: The Middle East\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://heropress.com/?p=1675\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"https://heropress.com/heropress-geography-middle-east/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3588:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"444\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/heropress_middle_east-min-1024x474.png\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"HeroPress pins on a google map in the Middle East\" /><p>For a while now I&#8217;ve been thinking about how to best leverage older content on HeroPress.

The camp, which held its sixth edition in Utrecht last year with more than 425 attendees, was one of the most well-established WordPress events in Europe. Yesterday lead organizer Marcel Bootsman published a <a href=\"https://nl.wordpress.org/team/2017/03/30/het-einde-van-wordcamp-the-netherlands/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> on the Dutch WordPress community site to explain why the camp has been cancelled.</p>\n<p>Bootsman&#8217;s post is written in Dutch but includes correspondence in English between the WCNL team and WordPress Community Support (WCS), formerly WordCamp Central. WCS is now pushing for all WordCamps to be city-based with the exception of regional camps, such as WordCamp US and WordCamp Europe, where the cities already have their own camps and do not prevent or detract from local communities launching their own camps.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordCamp Netherlands has been held 6 times to date and&#8230;It has not inspired any local WordCamps (in fact, I think it’s probably fair to say that local camps have not been happening because people don’t see a need for them with the country-wide camp happening each year) and, with the exception of Nijmegen, which is still in the pre-planning phase, no cities in the Netherlands have their own WordCamps,&#8221; a WCS representative said. &#8220;With that in mind, we feel that the time has come for your community to move from the country-wide camp to running local camps. This has started happening with Nijmegen already and can easily start happening more with WordCamps in Utrecht, Rotterdam, Amsterdam and other cities.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Netherlands is <a href=\"http://mapfight.appspot.com/nl-vs-us.md/netherlands-maryland-us-size-comparison\" target=\"_blank\">roughly the size of Maryland</a>, or twice the size of New Jersey, in terms of land space. One can drive across the country in two hours or less. The WCNL team contends that a country-wide WordCamp makes sense for geographical reasons and because of the locations of the organizers. The country already has an active meetup culture with 13 different meetups hosting an average of 100 attendees per event. Organizers do not see the need to have multiple smaller WordCamps fill the role that the local meetups are already doing.</p>\n<p>In response to the reasons WCNL organizers&#8217; outlined for not shutting down their event, the WCS representative replied, &#8220;I don’t think there’s really any benefit to responding to all of your points in the last email individually.&#8221; WCS reiterated its decision regarding the camp:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We will not be approving WordCamp The Netherlands 2017. We would like to see city-based WordCamps happening around the Netherlands – Nijmegen being a great start to that process.</p>\n<p>We’re confident that with the space that WCNL filled being vacated, we will see some of the meetup organizers around the country stepping up to fill that space for their local communities. The local city camps may be smaller, but in many ways that can be a much better than a single large camp.</p>\n<p>As I said before, we would be happy to look at doing WCNL again in a couple of years time once there are a few city-based camps around the country happening regularly. In that case, however, WCNL would be there to complement, and not replace, the city-based camps.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordCamp Netherlands was the last remaining exception to this new rule that drops country-wide WordCamps in favor of city-based camps. The Dutch community and many of its supporters are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/roytanck/status/847365810506969089\" target=\"_blank\">now</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jrf_nl/status/847470162496241664\" target=\"_blank\">in</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nielsvr/status/847384382541148161\" target=\"_blank\">an</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mchaste/status/847374014414704645\" target=\"_blank\">uproar</a> over the decision and organizers are at a crossroads. They can choose to rebrand the event as WordCamp Utrecht, with significant drawbacks, or move forward with an independent country-wide event without the use of WordCamp tools, branding and trademarks, or funding from the Global Community Sponsorship Program.</p>\n<h3>WordCamp Netherlands Conflict Highlights Cultural Differences Between the U.S. and Europe</h3>\n<p>Marcel Bootsman, who heads up the 13-person WordCamp Netherlands organization team, said they have been working since late December 2016 on the upcoming event. The team had added eight new members after the event grew 68% from 2015 to 2016.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Everybody was thrilled to start, and the news that we could not continue hit us hard,&#8221; Bootsman said. &#8220;We have officially stopped and I have thanked everyone for their enthusiasm and support, which was difficult because I wanted to let these people feel what it is to organize an event and see happy faces all over the place.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress developer and Dutch community member Juliette Reinders Folmer said she doesn&#8217;t believe that more than one or perhaps two city-based WordCamps will get started in the Netherlands. Organizing a WordCamp is not an easy endeavor with a small pool of local organizers and volunteers. Folmer notes that since the WordPress Foundation doesn&#8217;t allow for compensating speakers for their out-of-pocket costs, the speaker pool is further limited.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A trend I&#8217;ve spotted over the last few years is that &#8216;local&#8217; WCs will have a mix of local, national and international speakers,&#8221; Folmer said. &#8220;While national speakers might still be prepared to go out of pocket, the only international speakers who can afford to do this are the ones who are sponsored by big companies which pay their travel and time to speak at those WCs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Instead of creating a larger speaker group with new and interesting voices, we&#8217;re ending up with a corporate uniform message where the more innovative and sometimes dissident voices are few and far between. By forcing WCNL to break up into smaller more local groups, this trend will become even more persistent and insidious as the demands on the limited group of national speakers will increase unless they have corporate sponsoring. Even they will not able to afford the time and costs to attend and speak at the various local WCs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Remkus de Vries, WordCamp Netherlands lead-organizer from 2009 to 2015, said the team has worked for years to see the local communities come together, and have seen people get involved with translations, forum moderation, and local meetups after attending the WordCamps.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our idea from the get go for WordCamp Netherlands was to be as inclusive as possible, to unite the scattered Dutch WordPress community,&#8221; de Vries said. &#8220;The Dutch community consisted of little islands that didn&#8217;t really connect at all. We&#8217;ve been working very hard to unite our Dutch Community via WordCamp Netherlands and it was working perfectly.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Because of our inclusive approach we started getting international visitors and speakers from the early start as well, but more importantly, the event, as a national event, pulled everyone in from all corners of the Netherlands. Our community started and flourished because we started as a central entity.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bootsman is not optimistic about the future of the Dutch WordPress community after receiving the decision from WCS. The conflict has highlighted a key difference between U.S. and European cultures when it comes to traveling. Whereas Americans might think a 4-5 hour drive to another city is a short road trip, Europe&#8217;s population is much more dense than the U.S. and traveling several hours to another city is not common.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When there is no WordCamp Netherlands, my personal belief is that this will break up the community,&#8221; Bootsman said. &#8220;Of course we will have central tools like Slack, nl.w.org and other ways to communicate, but that is nothing compared to an event where all these people can meet. People are busy and can&#8217;t find time to visit multiple WordCamps in the Netherlands. Distances are not that large in NL, that is not an issue, but time is. When you have a central WordCamp The Netherlands once a year you plan, so you are available to go. In the new situation, when there is a WordCamp Rotterdam, why visit a WordCamp in another town? This maybe hard to understand, but this is how it works for Dutch people. We&#8217;re too practical sometimes, and in this situation, it will not help the community.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordCamp Netherlands Organizers are Considering Hosting an Independent Event</h3>\n<p>Both de Vries and Bootsman are said they do not believe rules that make sense for the U.S. should be applied universally. They would prefer them to be guidelines that communities can follow or depart from if they express their preference for a country-wide WordCamp. WordPress communities in other countries like Denmark, Croatia, and Switzerland have expressed similar frustrations with the U.S.-centric rules.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordCamp Netherlands was what started the local WordPress meetups and ended up being the glue between the WordPress Meetups,&#8221; de Vries said. &#8220;Forcing us to stop using WordCamp Netherlands is going to impact that as you could see by the outpouring of reactions yesterday on Twitter and Facebook. Renaming WordCamp Netherlands to WordCamp Utrecht, as suggested by many, could be a solution, but nobody of the organizing team lives in the city which means, per the WCS rules, we can&#8217;t do that. But more importantly, we would be losing &#8216;our glue.&#8217; We feel that our efforts of the last years have just been flushed down the toilet with this &#8216;one-size-fits-all&#8217; rule.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although WCNL organizers were told in no uncertain terms that their camp is cancelled, a recent <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/03/30/wordcamp-netherlands-today-the/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> on the Community team blog indicates that representatives are considering feedback on the decision.</p>\n<p>The first two WordCamp Netherlands were not under the umbrella of WordCamp Central, and de Vries said they will find a way to have the camp if it comes to that. Organizers are currently examining their options.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is too soon to announce things about this but let me say that we feel the Netherlands needs to have a countrywide WordPress event based on the experiences of the last years,&#8221; Bootsman said. &#8220;We are not going to let the Netherlands WordPress community down.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 31 Mar 2017 23:39:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:8:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Wed, 26 Apr 2017 17:50:50 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Wed, 26 Apr 2017 17:30:10 GMT\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:11:\"HIT lax 250\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20140127131327\";}','no'),(22851,'_transient_timeout_feed_b9388c83948825c1edaef0d856b7b109','1493272252','no'),(22852,'_transient_feed_b9388c83948825c1edaef0d856b7b109','a:4:{s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:3:\"rss\";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"\n\n\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:7:\"version\";s:3:\"2.0\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:7:\"channel\";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:3:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"Popular — WordPress Plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wordpress.org/plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"Plugins extend and expand the functionality of WordPress.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:13:\"lastBuildDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Apr 2017 17:38:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"language\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"en-US\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:9:\"generator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"https://wordpress.org/?v=4.8-alpha-40555\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"item\";a:10:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Contact Form 7\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/#respond\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 02 Aug 2007 12:43:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://wordpress.org/plugins-wp/contact-form-7/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"Just another contact form plugin.

This was true when Joost wrote his original <a href=\"https://yoast.com/articles/wordpress-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WordPress SEO</a> article in 2008 (updated every few months) and it&#8217;s still true today, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t improve it further! This plugin is written from the ground up by Joost de Valk and his team at <a href=\"https://yoast.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast</a> to improve your site&#8217;s SEO on <em>all</em> needed aspects. While this <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast SEO plugin</a> goes the extra mile to take care of all the technical optimization, more on that below, it first and foremost helps you write better content.  Yoast SEO forces you to choose a focus keyword when you&#8217;re writing your articles, and then makes sure you use that focus keyword everywhere.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Premium Support</strong><br />\n  The Yoast team does not always provide active support for the Yoast SEO plugin on the WordPress.org forums. One-on-one email support is available to people who bought the <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo-premium/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Premium Yoast SEO plugin</a> only.<br />\n  Note that the Premium SEO plugin has several extra features too, including the option to have multiple focus keywords and a redirect manager, so it might be well worth your investment!</p>\n<p>You should also check out the <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/local-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast Local SEO</a>, <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/news-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast News SEO</a> and <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/video-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast Video SEO</a> extensions to Yoast SEO. These of course come with support too.</p>\n<p><strong>Bug Reports</strong><br />\n  Bug reports for Yoast SEO are <a href=\"https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo\" rel=\"nofollow\">welcomed on GitHub</a>. Please note GitHub is <em>not</em> a support forum, and issues that aren&#8217;t properly qualified as bugs will be closed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Write better content with Yoast SEO</h4>\n<p>Using the snippet preview, you can see a rendering of what your post or page will look like in the search results, whether your title is too long or too short, and whether your meta description makes sense in the context of a search result. This way the plugin will help you not only increase rankings but also increase the click through rate for organic search results.</p>\n<h4>Page Analysis</h4>\n<p>The Yoast SEO plugins <a href=\"https://yoast.com/content-seo-wordpress-linkdex/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Page Analysis</a> functionality checks simple things you&#8217;re bound to forget. It checks, for instance, if you have images in your post and whether they have an alt tag containing the focus keyword for that post. It also checks whether your posts are long enough, whether you&#8217;ve written a meta description and if that meta description contains your focus keyword, if you&#8217;ve used any subheadings within your post, etc. etc.</p>\n<p>The plugin alsgruo allows you to write meta titles and descriptions for all your category, tag and custom taxonomy archives, giving you the option to further optimize those pages.</p>\n<p>Combined, this plugin makes sure that your content is the type of content search engines will love!</p>\n<h4>Technical WordPress Search Engine Optimization</h4>\n<p>While out of the box WordPress is pretty good for SEO, it needs some tweaks here and there. This Yoast SEO plugin guides you through some of the settings needed, for instance by reminding you to enable pretty permalinks. But it also goes beyond that, by automatically optimizing and inserting the meta tags and link elements that Google and other search engines like so much:</p>\n<h4>Meta &amp; Link Elements</h4>\n<p>With the Yoast SEO plugin you can control which pages Google shows in its search results and which pages it doesn&#8217;t show. By default, it will tell search engines to index all of your pages, including category and tag archives, but to only show the first pages in the search results. It&#8217;s not very useful for a user to end up on the third page of your &#8220;personal&#8221; category, right?</p>\n<p>WordPress itself only shows canonical link elements on single pages, but Yoast SEO makes it output canonical link elements everywhere. Google has recently announced they would also use <code>rel=\"next\"</code> and <code>rel=\"prev\"</code> link elements in the <code>head</code> section of your paginated archives. This plugin adds those automatically. See <a href=\"https://yoast.com/rel-next-prev-paginated-archives/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this post</a> for more info.</p>\n<h4>XML Sitemaps</h4>\n<p>The Yoast SEO plugin has the most advanced XML Sitemaps functionality in any WordPress plugin. Once you check the box, it automatically creates XML sitemaps and notifies Google &amp; Bing of the sitemaps&#8217; existence. These XML sitemaps include the images in your posts &amp; pages too, so that your images may be found better in the search engines too.</p>\n<p>These XML Sitemaps will even work on large sites, because of how they&#8217;re created, using one index sitemap that links to sub-sitemaps for each 1,000 posts. They will also work with custom post types and custom taxonomies automatically, while giving you the option to remove those from the XML sitemap should you wish to.</p>\n<p>Because of using <a href=\"https://yoast.com/xsl-stylesheet-xml-sitemap/\" rel=\"nofollow\">XSL stylesheets for these XML Sitemaps</a>, the XML sitemaps are easily readable for the human eye too, so you can spot things that shouldn&#8217;t be in there.</p>\n<h4>RSS Optimization</h4>\n<p>Are you being outranked by scrapers? Instead of cursing at them, use them to your advantage! By automatically adding a link to your RSS feed pointing back to the original article, you&#8217;re telling the search engine where they should be looking for the original. This way, the Yoast SEO plugin increases your own chance of ranking for your chosen keywords and gets rid of scrapers in one go!</p>\n<h4>Breadcrumbs</h4>\n<p>If your theme is compatible, and themes based on for instance Genesis or by WooThemes often are, you can use the built-in Breadcrumbs functionality. This allows you to create an easy navigation that is great for both users and search engines, and will support the search engines in understanding the structure of your site.</p>\n<p>Making your theme compatible isn&#8217;t hard either, check <a href=\"https://kb.yoast.com/kb/implement-wordpress-seo-breadcrumbs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">these instructions</a>.</p>\n<h4>Edit your .htaccess and robots.txt file</h4>\n<p>Using the built-in file editor, you can edit your WordPress blog&#8217;s <code>.htaccess</code> and <code>robots.txt</code> file, giving you direct access to the two most powerful files, from an SEO perspective, in your WordPress install.</p>\n<h4>Social Integration</h4>\n<p>SEO and Social Media are heavily intertwined. That&#8217;s why this plugin also comes with a Facebook OpenGraph implementation and will soon also support Google+ sharing tags.</p>\n<h4>Multi-Site Compatible</h4>\n<p>The Yoast SEO plugin, unlike some others, is fully Multi-Site compatible. The XML Sitemaps work fine in all setups and you even have the option, in the Network settings, to copy the settings from one blog to another, or make blogs default to the settings for a specific blog.</p>\n<h4>Import &amp; Export functionality</h4>\n<p>If you have multiple blogs, setting up plugins like this one on all of them might seem like a daunting task. Except that it&#8217;s not, because what you can do is simple: you set up the plugin once. You then export your settings and simply import them on all your other sites. It&#8217;s that simple!</p>\n<h4>Import functionality for other WordPress SEO plugins</h4>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve used All In One SEO Pack or HeadSpace2 before using this plugin, you might want to import all your old titles and descriptions. You can do that easily using the built-in import functionality. There&#8217;s also import functionality for some of the older Yoast plugins, like Robots Meta and RSS footer.</p>\n<p>Should you have a need to import from another SEO plugin to Yoast SEO, or from a theme like Genesis or Thesis, you can use the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/seo-data-transporter/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SEO Data Transporter</a> plugin, which will easily convert your SEO meta data from and to a whole set of plugins like Platinum SEO, SEO Ultimate, Greg&#8217;s High Performance SEO, and themes like Headway, Hybrid, WooFramework, Catalyst etc.</p>\n<p>Read <a href=\"https://yoast.com/all-in-one-seo-pack-migration/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this migration guide</a> if you still have questions about migrating from another SEO plugin to Yoast SEO.</p>\n<h4>Yoast SEO Plugin in your Language!</h4>\n<p>Currently a huge translation project is underway, translating Yoast SEO in as much as 24 languages. So far, the translations for French and Dutch are complete, but we still need help on a lot of other languages, so if you&#8217;re good at translating, please join us at <a href=\"http://translate.yoast.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">translate.yoast.com</a>.</p>\n<h4>News SEO</h4>\n<p>Be sure to also check out the premium <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/news-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">News SEO module</a> if you need Google News Sitemaps.

<code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Go to the Tools -&gt; Import screen, click on WordPress</li>\n</ol>\n</dd>\n<dt>Help! I&#8217;m getting out of memory errors or a blank screen.</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>If your exported file is very large, the import script may run into your host&#8217;s configured memory limit for PHP.</p>\n<p>A message like &#8220;Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 8388608 bytes exhausted&#8221; indicates that the script can&#8217;t successfully import your XML file under the current PHP memory limit. If you have access to the php.ini file, you can manually increase the limit; if you do not (your WordPress installation is hosted on a shared server, for instance), you might have to break your exported XML file into several smaller pieces and run the import script one at a time.</p>\n<p>For those with shared hosting, the best alternative may be to consult hosting support to determine the safest approach for running the import.

Built to integrate seamlessly with WordPress, WooCommerce is the world’s favorite eCommerce solution that gives both store owners and developers complete control.</p>\n<p>With endless flexibility and access to hundreds of free and premium WordPress extensions, WooCommerce now powers 30% of all online stores &#8212; more than any other platform.</p>\n<iframe class=\'youtube-player\' type=\'text/html\' width=\'640\' height=\'390\' src=\'https://www.youtube.com/embed/1KahlicghaE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent\' allowfullscreen=\'true\' style=\'border:0;\'></iframe>\n<h4>Sell anything, anywhere</h4>\n<p>With WooCommerce, you can sell both physical and digital goods in all shapes and sizes, offer product variations, multiple configurations, and instant downloads to shoppers, and even sell affiliate goods from online marketplaces.</p>\n<p>With premium extensions, you can offer bookings, memberships, and recurring subscriptions. Perhaps you’d like to sell monthly subscriptions for physical goods, or offer your members a discount on digital downloads? It’s all possible.</p>\n<h4>Ship wherever you like</h4>\n<p>Offer free shipping, flat rate shipping, or make real-time calculations. Limit your shipments to specific countries, or open your store up to the world. Shipping is highly configurable, and WooCommerce even supports drop shipping.</p>\n<h4>Extensive payment options</h4>\n<p>WooCommerce comes bundled with the ability to accept major credit cards, PayPal, BACS (bank transfers), and cash on delivery. Need additional options? More than 140 region-specific gateways integrate with WooCommerce, including popular choices like Stripe, Authorize.Net, and Amazon Payments.</p>\n<h4>You control it all &#8212; forever</h4>\n<p>WooCommerce gives you complete control of your store, from taxes to stock levels to customer accounts. Add and remove extensions, change your design, and switch settings as you please. It’s all under your control.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest risks of using a hosted eCommerce platform is what happens to your store if the provider closes up shop. With WooCommerce, you have complete control, so there’s never any reason to worry. Your data belongs to you &#8212; and it’s kept secure, thanks to regular audits by industry leaders.</p>\n<h4>Define your style with Storefront</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/storefront/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Storefront</a> is a free WordPress theme available to any WooCommerce store. Along with deep WooCommerce integration, Storefront prioritizes speed and uptime while eliminating theme and plugin conflicts during major updates.</p>\n<p>Define your style even further by customizing Storefront to your liking or choosing from one of our several <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/product-category/themes/storefront-child-theme-themes/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Storefront child themes</a>. It’s all up to you, and all open source.</p>\n<h4>Built with developers in mind</h4>\n<p>Extendable, adaptable, and open source &#8212; WooCommerce was created with developers in mind. With its strong, robust framework, you can scale your client’s store all the way from basic to high-end (infinity and beyond).</p>\n<p>Built with a REST API, WooCommerce can integrate with virtually any service. Your store’s data can be accessed anywhere, anytime, 100% securely. WooCommerce allows developers to easily create, modify, and grow a store that meets their specifications.</p>\n<p>No matter the size of the store you want to build, WooCommerce will scale to meet your requirements. With a growing collection of more than 300 extensions, you can enhance each store’s features to meet your client’s unique needs &#8212; or even create your own solution.</p>\n<p>If security is a concern, rest easy. WooCommerce is audited by a dedicated team of developers working around the clock to identify and patch any and all discovered bugs.</p>\n<p>We also support WooCommerce and all its extensions with comprehensive, easily-accessible documentation. With our docs, you’ll learn how to create the exact site your client needs.</p>\n<h4>Extensions galore</h4>\n<p>WordPress.org is home to some amazing extensions for WooCommerce, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-google-analytics-integration/\">Google Analytics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-delivery-notes/\">Delivery Notes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips/\">PDF Invoices and Packing Slips</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/affiliates-woocommerce-light/\">Affiliates Integration Light</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-new-product-badge/\">New Product Badges</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keen to see them all?

That should return things to normal.</p>\n<h4>Dummy data</h4>\n<p>WooCommerce comes with some dummy data you can use to see how products look; either import dummy_data.xml via the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-importer/\">WordPress importer</a> or use our <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/products/product-csv-import-suite/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CSV Import Suite plugin</a> to import dummy_data.csv and dummy_data_variations.csv.</p>\n</dd>\n<dt>Where can I find WooCommerce documentation and user guides?</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>For help setting up and configuring WooCommerce please refer to our <a href=\"https://docs.woocommerce.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/\" rel=\"nofollow\">user guide</a></p>\n<p>For extending or theming WooCommerce, see our <a href=\"https://docs.woocommerce.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/woocommerce-codex/\" rel=\"nofollow\">codex</a>.</p>\n</dd>\n<dt>Where can I get support or talk to other users?</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>If you get stuck, you can ask for help in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce\" rel=\"nofollow\">WooCommerce Plugin Forum</a>.</p>\n<p>For help with premium extensions from WooThemes, use <a href=\"https://support.woothemes.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">our helpdesk</a>.</p>\n</dd>\n<dt>Will WooCommerce work with my theme?</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>Yes; WooCommerce will work with any theme, but may require some styling to make it match nicely.

This is meant to allow you to be aware of any suspicious activity from whitelisted IPs.</p>\n</dd>\n<dt>I locked myself out testing this thing, what do I do?</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>Either wait, or:</p>\n<p>If you know how to edit / add to PHP files you can use the IP whitelist functionality described above. You should then use the &#8220;Restore Lockouts&#8221; button on the plugin settings page and remove the whitelist function again.</p>\n<p>If you have ftp / ssh access to the site rename the file &#8220;wp-content/plugins/limit-login-attempts/limit-login-attempts.php&#8221; to deactivate the plugin.</p>\n<p>If you have access to the database (for example through phpMyAdmin) you can clear the limit_login_lockouts option in the wordpress options table.

Please upgrade immediately.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Auth cookies&#8221; are special cookies set at login that authenticating you to the system. It is how WordPress &#8220;remembers&#8221; that you are logged in between page loads.</p>\n<p>During lockout these are supposed to be cleared, but a change in 1.6.2 broke this. It allowed an attacker to keep trying to break these cookies during a lockout.</p>\n<p>Lockout of normal password login attempts still worked as it should, and it appears that all &#8220;auth cookie&#8221; attempts would keep getting logged.</p>\n<p>In theory the &#8220;auth cookie&#8221; is quite resistant to brute force attack. It contains a cryptographic hash of the user password, and the difficulty to break it is not based on the password strength but instead on the cryptographic operations used and the length of the hash value. In theory it should take many many years to break this hash. As theory and practice does not always agree it is still a good idea to have working lockouts of any such attempts.</p>\n<h4>1.7.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added filter that allows whitelisting IP.

This can range from placing a business information widget in the best location to providing a sample menu with social icon links to a static front page complete with beautiful images. Don’t worry &#8211; nothing new will appear on the live site until you’re ready to save and publish your initial theme setup.</p>\n<div style=\"float: left;width: 48%;margin: 0\">\n<h3>Edit Shortcuts</h3>\n<div style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-4596-2\" width=\"300\" height=\"173\" poster=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/4.7-—-Edit-Shortcuts.jpg\" loop=\"1\" autoplay=\"1\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/edit-shortcuts.mp4?_=2\" /><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/edit-shortcuts.mp4\">https://wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/edit-shortcuts.mp4</a></video></div>\n<p>Visible icons appear to show you which parts of your site can be customized while live previewing.

Just as JavaScript is a near necessity for smoother user experiences and more modern PHP versions are critical for performance, SSL just makes sense as the next hurdle our users are going to face.</p>\n<p>SSL basically means the link between your browser and the server is encrypted. SSL used to be difficult to implement, and often expensive or slow. Modern browsers, and the incredible success of projects like <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/\">Let&#8217;s Encrypt</a> have made getting a certificate to secure your site fast, free, and something we think every host should support by default, especially in a post-Snowden era. Google also weighs <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal_6.html\">SSL as a search engine ranking factor</a> and will begin <a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/read/google-will-soon-shame-all-websites-that-are-unencrypted-chrome-https\">flagging unencrypted sites in Chrome</a>.</p>\n<p>First, early in 2017, we will only promote hosting partners that provide a SSL certificate by default in their accounts. Later we will begin to assess which features, such as API authentication, would benefit the most from SSL and make them only enabled when SSL is there.</p>\n<p>Separately, I also think the performance improvements in PHP7 are particularly impressive, and major kudos to everyone who worked on that. We will consider whether hosts use PHP7 by default for new accounts next year as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"4588\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"WordPress 4.7 Release Candidate\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/11/wordpress-4-7-release-candidate/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 24 Nov 2016 04:26:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4579\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:328:\"The release candidate for WordPress 4.7 is now available.

The REST API endpoints saw a number of bugfixes and notably now have anonymous comment off by default.</p>\n<p>Not sure where to start with testing?

I know you might not ever want to hear from me again, but I will give you the benefit of the doubt in the case that it will settle curiosity, peace of mind, or in the very least, interest. Today I was going through a box of old letters and read a few from you, still as crisp and neat as the day I got them. You were sweet to me, open, and understanding. I have a couple memories otherwise, but I think they are merely distortions of my perception at the time due to my hypersensitive emotions. I want you to know that you were (and probably still are) sweet and caring to me. You had a lot of sense and understanding and probably handled our situation exactly as it should have been handled, which is probably not true of the behavior from my end. It\'s been too long for me to truly know for sure, but of what little evidence I have of the communication between you and me, what I\'ve seen doesn\'t look like I treated you reasonably. That\'s not to say that I truly mistreated you--I don\'t think that is true--but I think that I could have been better. Well, I couldn\'t have been better, but I should have been. Had I known any better.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI\'ve learned a lot about myself in the past 6 years, and I can tell you that any way I treated you was not because I was a mean person or that I had bad intentions, but because I cared about you so much and wanted you in my life so badly that I eventually got to the point of desperation which completely distorts our own perception of how to act and how not to act. Regardless of how I acted or you acted or who was right and who was wrong, none of which I remember well enough to know either way, I want to extend an apology to you for anything in between--for what I did, for what I didn\'t do, for what I shouldn\'t have done, and for what I didn\'t know to do. I\'m making these judgements based on the fact that you haven\'t talked to me since then, and clearly had no desire to do so many years ago. I can\'t do much, but I can tell you I\'m sorry. Even if I never was before, I am now.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI was always confused as to why you wouldn\'t talk to me. I\'m sure there was reason for a while, but I had hoped and expected that some time it would fade away and at least move in the positive direction, if only slightly. Yet, it only continued to move in the negative. For a long time, I did what I needed to do to rid myself of any attraction to you, which took many years, believe it or not, and I presume that is what caused so much harm, of all the things we ever went though. I want you to know that I have no feelings of negativity to you in any way, regardless of what that might mean to you. I have many negative memories of us and feelings of hopelessness, but I\'ve shelved them away and dusted off the positive over the years and moved them to the front. I still remember what it was like the first day I met you and the power you had over me and my heart. I was such a helpless young man, and such a slave to my feelings. I still am, really. You were so beautiful then, and I believe that if I knew you today, you still would be. Both inside your heart and outside with your presence.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI really, really hope that you are doing well. I really, really hope that you are happy. I hope that Boston was everything you ever dreamed it was, and I hope that you\'ve found a happy life in what it\'s been after you knew me. You don\'t ever have to want to talk to me again, and that\'s perfectly okay, but I want to offer you a hand as a lost friend and any other benevolence that I can offer. I am still the exact same boy that you once knew, and though I haven\'t changed much, I have certainly grown. And you were a huge part of that. And you gave me years and years of growth, even after I never knew you any more. There was a time in my life, long after you kindly let me out of your life that I didn\'t think I would ever stop struggling with the hole you left in it. And I was always surprised with how that was--I\'m sure I took things way too seriously. But it was mostly for how badly I wanted you in my life, yet that\'s just not how it works. Thank you for treating me how you did. Thank you for pushing me away when you realized you weren\'t happy. Thank you for being down to earth, blunt, and honest. Thank you for standing up for yourself. And most of all, thank you for not putting up with my emotions of desperation. Honestly, you probably put up with them much more than you should have.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI don\'t expect a response, and you certainly don\'t have to, but if it means anything to you and you would like to, I am completely open to hearing from you. Whether it\'s short, long, criticism, openness, small talk, an update, or a giant list of all the things you hated about me--I don\'t care--I will be open to anything and would love to hear from you regardless of what the content is. And if you\'re curious at all as to what my life is like or who I am these days, I will gladly tell you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf anything, I hope this letter is one of encouragement to you. You were such a light in my life and and though you were a very painful light, you taught me a lot and made me feel things I\'ve never felt before. You made me happier than anyone I had ever known. I still remember the feelings you made me feel that were unique in a way that no one has ever made me feel since--because you are your very own unique person that is different from anyone else. If I never hear from you again, I wish you the very best and hope that your life is a wonderful adventure full of twists, turns, surprises, and excitement.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLove from your old friend,\r\n\r\nRussell Strauss','to cyndi','','publish','open','closed','','to-cyndi','','','2012-10-01 22:07:17','2012-10-02 02:07:17','',0,'http://journal.rruffles.com/?p=650',0,'post','',0),(666,2,'2012-09-17 21:47:23','2012-09-18 01:47:23','I thought my life was going to go one way and then it went another. I’m fine with it most days but then there are certain moments, such as these, when I’m suffocated by the weight of my own failures. I’ve pretended for so long that this part of me was shut off, damaged goods, that it just wasn’t ever going to happen for me. I became resigned and defeated. Content with my discontent.\r\n\r\nThen the fire will spark and I’ll feel cheated. All of a sudden, I want to get what’s owed to me. I want to get more than what I currently have.\r\n\r\nI’m talking here about love, of course. The act of getting it and then sustaining the connection. Growing up, I always knew that I had a lot of love to give. I felt everything; I felt everyone. I’m always placing my hand on a friend’s body out of habit just so I can be closer to them. There’s no such thing as too close. I’m always looking for connections wherever I go.\r\n\r\n<em>Remind me why I’m here. C’mere.</em>\r\n\r\nI imagined my young adult life to be spent in a series of different people’s beds, limbs entangled, light peeking through the window, fingertips going up and down the back to initiate morning sex. I can so clearly visualize the scene: I’m cooking breakfast for someone. Music is wafting through the laptop speakers and I’m watching a man get dressed. I’m watching his ass, the curve of his back, as he gets clothed and moves forward to kiss me goodbye. Then, when he leaves, the energy will get sucked from the room, the spell will be broken, and I’ll need to go get it again.\r\n\r\nSounds familiar, right? Sounds like something that’s plucked from the pages of your life? I know it is because I’ve been studying it. But despite all of my desire and wanting, there’s been no naked backs hanging from the edge of my bed, no quick passionate kisses goodbye while I’m still half-asleep. There’s been nothing.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, I don’t understand the motions of sex and love. I am not a part of the club.\r\n\r\nOf course, a lot of these failures have to do with me. You can only blame others for so long before realizing that you are a part of the problem. Perhaps what’s more adult than wearing your lover’s shirt and cooking breakfast for them in the morning is coming to the realization that you’re screwed up. Something inside of you broke and it’s up to you to fix it.\r\n\r\nHere’s another familiar scene for you: You look around a room that’s full of your friends and realize you are the only one who isn’t spoken for. Everyone else is clutching on to the arm of their partner while your grip on the bottle of wine stiffens.\r\n\r\nAnother one: You go on a family vacation and realize you are the only one who didn’t bring a significant other. You get to sleep on the pullout because it’s only you and it’s better for one person to be uncomfortable rather than two. <em>Actually, I guarantee that I’m the one who will be in more pain BECAUSE I’m alone.</em>\r\n\r\nLast one: A man brushes your shoulder on the subway and your body practically has convulsions. It’s then that you realize that you haven’t been touched in a long time.\r\n\r\nIt’s easy to sit here and ask, “When will I be spoken for? When will I have someone to bring on the family vacation? When will I get used to someone’s touch?”\r\n\r\nWhen will it be my turn to fall in love?\r\n\r\nI don’t know. No one knows. Stop buying the books that tell you when because they’re merely profiting off of your vulnerabilities. Just focus on yourself and pray that the fire never stops sparking. Pray that you never get used to all of this because the second you do, it’s yours forever.','when will it be my turn to fall in love?','','publish','open','closed','','when-will-it-be-my-turn-to-fall-in-love','','','2012-10-01 22:04:04','2012-10-02 02:04:04','',0,'http://journal.rruffles.com/?p=666',0,'post','',0),(623,2,'2012-07-25 20:21:02','2012-07-26 01:21:02','I believe that God gave me a brain for a reason. God gave me a heart to follow for a reason. He did not simpy put me on this earth to follow rules, but to live life to its fullest.\r\n\r\nAnd life to its fullest means something different for every man. And that\'s why he gave me my head to use to my own advantage. I take what I learn from the Bible very liberally. I do not follow it word for word, nor do I agree with everything it says. Yet even then, I do not think it always leads me in the right direction when I follow it too strictly. There are too many contradictions to do so. God\'s word is not about rules, but about love. Do not misinterpret, I believe the word is a huge source of guidance that every man should look to for every decision he makes, but so many simply do not know how to read it. I\'m exaggerating a little and being a tad disrespectful, but trying to communicate my perspective without being able to easily do so. But what if God added these contradictions that we not listen to everything we are told but to learn from life and follow our hearts? I\'ve certainly learned that had I followed everything the church taught me and tried to live out the prude, closed-minded perspective of today\'s christians, I would not be living life to its fullest. I would be living a life that, to me, could not be its happiest.\r\n\r\nBut I\'ve carefully listened for God. I\'ve squinted my eyes, tried hard to see what\'s right, and attempted to follow after that small speck of light. I\'ve always done my best. And that\'s why I\'m completely happy. That\'s why I\'m completely satisfied with my life and where I am. But what if I don\'t continue to do this in everything that I do?\r\n\r\nI think I\'m coming to a fork in the road. I can decide to learn for myself and do as God has taught me, to follow my heart and take risks, or I can decide to live a sterile and protected life, free of potential hurt, missing out on things I need.\r\n\r\nBut am I just trying to justify a wrong decision? Possibly. Is it likely? Yes. But am I following my heart? Yes. Am I listening to everything that whispers guidance in my direction, trying desperately to figure out what is right? Of course I am.\r\n\r\nI may not make the right decision, but I will certainly make the decision that I believe is right, closely trying to live my life as God has taught me in order to live my life to its fullest potential.\r\n\r\nFollowing my heart one-hundred percent of the way.','the way i was made','','inherit','open','closed','','601-revision-9','','','2012-07-25 20:21:02','2012-07-26 01:21:02','',601,'http://journal.rruffles.com/601-revision-9/',0,'revision','',0),(4,2,'2004-01-18 21:46:00','2004-01-18 21:46:00','<p>Today was Sunday! Woohoo! I love Sundays, but today wasn\'t really that great. When I go tto church I took a walk on the trail in the woods. (My parent\'s don\'t go to my church any more. ugh.... So I have to get to church early so that they can get ot heir church on time) Kellie and I were very uptight this morning when we first got there. After we got through with that, the big people church was much better. It helped me loosen up. I was really stressed out about everything. After churc, I tried to see if I could go to Kellie\'s house(dream on) until Fuel, but I couldn\'t of course. When we got home I put a bunch of pictures in a picture album I got for Christams. That took an hour or so. Then I ate and I wanted to get on the computer after I was finished. In the end, I ended up kicking my brother and he yelled and woke them up and I got in BIG trouble. Then I had to pay him 10 bucks for something...it\'s a long story for another day. Eventually, we left for Fuel and that wasn\'t too bad. Hopefully I\'ll actually do it right this semester. I doubt I\'ll get it right this time, I never do. Anyway, after that we got out and Kellie was in the parking lot. She was really upset and wouldn\'t talk to me. I am upposed to be calling her now. I\'ll do that when I\'m done. Then we went to eat at Wendy\'s like we always do. Me and and Chuck REALLY wanted to run across the street to Moe\'s but we couldn\'t. After I got home, I started talking to Karyn and Annie. It was great. They really listen what I have to say. Well, that\'s my day. I need to go call Kellie.</p>\r\n<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Godspeed.</p>','Jan. 18','','publish','open','open','','jan-18','','','2004-01-18 21:46:00','2004-01-18 21:46:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=4',0,'post','',4),(5,2,'2004-01-20 22:02:00','2004-01-20 22:02:00','It\'s Tuesday. Time for bed, actually. Nobody goes to bed at the same time everytnight anyway. At least, I don\'t. I definately don\'t. I can barely get into bed period. Anyway, I forgot what I was going to say. It looks like soon I\'ll be going to sleep and getting right back up again. Then I will struggle to get on the bus on time and minutes later be at school. I will sit in class all day, trying to do work or talking to my \"friends\". Then, I come home and within minutes, it will be time for rest once again. Figures, but I don\'t mind. I love my life anyway. Sometimes I wonder if I could ever ask for more. God has given me so much. Even things that I don\'t care about that are amazing. Just like the wind. It is most likely not a life changing experience, but an amazing thing. Think about it. Just being able to go out into your yard and lie in the grass. Nobody does that, but when you think about it, senses are amazing. Those are just the little things. Huge things like my relationships, I can\'t even imagine why God would give someone like me something so amazing. I love it. Sometimes they are hard,  but always worth it. I could never understand why people say \"love sucks\". No one can live without love. I couldn\'t live without my friends, family, teachers, youth leaders, and many other people that have changed my life. Most of all, I live off of God\'s love. Everyone does. Most of them don\'t even know it, which is heart breaking. I could never imagine living without God. That would be absolutely horrible. \r\n\r\nYesterday, was very fun. I got to go to Discover Mills with many of my friends even though some of my best ones couldn\'t come. Actually, they were all at Jacob\'s house. I don\'t understand it. They always leave me out of everything they do. I asked Derek to come over Sunday night. He siad he couldn\'t. Instead he decides to go to Jacob\'s house...along with Chuck. Nobody wanted to come to my house. Nobody wanted me to come. But still, I got to go to Discover Mills with people that don\'t leave me out of things and do care about me. I got to spend the day with, Kellie, Chris (the one guy I can talk to), Karyn (one of my newer friends that also cares about me), and Annie. It was fun, but much different than I expected. Annie and Karyn didn\'t really get ot meet any of my real friends. I think it would have been different if we had gone after church, with more people from church.\r\n\r\nOver the last week Kellie has been really upset about me talking to Karyn. I don\'t really understand why she cares so much. I can see her worrying, but she was totally out of hand. She got really upset last night. I will pray and ask anyone else to do the same. I wish she would understand that I\'m really not attracted to anyone but her, whatsoever. \r\n\r\nToday was okay. I was really tired from staying up late. I want to get to bed early tonight, but I guess it\'s too late for that. I went to school which was the same as always, but I had Computer Science which made the day seem much longer. I have CREATE tomorrow, which is good. That will get me excited. Also, we have the Trail. I will have to be a car rider, which last week I forgot(hahaha). I got on the bus and the jerkface bus driver wouldn\'t let me off when I remembered. My parents had to come pick me up at my house, which was cool because I didn\'t have to go straight there but still got there early. I told Karyn to remind me tomorrow. I hope she remembers becuase I will most likely forget. I really want her to come to the Trail sometime. She told me that she is Catholic, which made me wonder. I don\'t think that there would really be that much of a difference even though it seems like there would be. I want to ask Tait about it. Either way, I think she would love it, as long as she isn\'t shy. It looks like she wants to come ot Sharptop. I\'ll have to ask her about that. If she is going to come, I need to get her signed up. It will be fun. I just hope Kellie doesn\'t freak out. I told her, and she didn\'t seem to mind much. \r\n\r\nWell, I think it\'s time to retire for tonight. Pray that I\'m not tired in the morning. That would be awesome.

Even if I only learn one thing that helps me from that class, I will be thankful.\r\n\r\nMy parents are really starting to bother me. I think they are way too headstrong and bossy. I know that is their job but they really have a bad attitude about somethings. I don\'t really even know what to say about them. I\'ll just leave it at that.\r\n\r\nTonight at the Trail, Tait talked about loneliness. It really hit me because lately, none of my friends have invited me to do anything and they haven\'t been excited about doing anything with me either. I have been really lonely. After he was done, Chuck was talking to me about how he was really sad about next year because he is a year younger than all of us, and we will be in high school next year. That means we won\'t get to do stuff with us anymore. It\'s been really hard for me this year becuase Kellie, Derek, and Mitch are in high school, but next year Chuck will be completely alone. I can\'t imagine that. So this is what I told him. I looked at him and said, \"Chuck, next year, you will be able to come over to my house whenever you want to. Call me up, and I\'ll ask my parents and if they say yes, you can always come over.\" Then we went out to Moe\'s with Tait and him and they invited me to come to something at the Gwinnett Civic Center this Friday. All of that stuff tonight made me feel so much better. It made me feel like I finally had a friend that would do stuff with me. We were also talking about stuff that we would do with the Trail this year. I think I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. I have friends at school that help me get through the day now. I am starting to grab hold of my school work. I can start trying to do stuff with Chuck. We will have things going on with the Trail. Then, before long, it will be summer and I will finally be in high school. This is the year I have been waiting for. I will finally be with almost all of my friends again. It\'s all downhill from here. I\'m starting to have hope. Even if it isn\'t getting better yet, it will definately get better soon. I bet it will be mid-terms soon. Then, the school year will be over before I know it. Hmmm....I wonder what I will do without Mr. Moore. That will be boring. Anyway, time to go to bed. I still have to do my amth, but I pretty much have it done. Everyone, pray that I finish my biogaphy in LA in time. That\'s the only thing I\'m worrying about.

So, by the time we were done, we were like hola crap this is great we\'re going to print this. So, Noemi printed it and brang it to school (shhh no one has to know that I printed one too). Then, Mr. Moore took it up and everyone was scared that we were going to get in so much trouble because we brought it to school and because we were copying Noemi\'s essay and everything. A couple of them got called to Mrs. Layfield\'s room during connections to talk about it. Then Noemi, Serena, and Robin(I think Serena did it too) stole the essay from M&M\'s desk when he left the room. So todya M&M talked to all of the classes about it and told us that it was great that we had out little study group(hahaha) and that we hadn\'t done anything wrong.

I was just sitting there MINDING MY OWN BUISNESS, and he came over and said, \"I think I\'ll take this,\" or something like that. IT WAS SO RETARDED. Then to make things worse, he wouldn\'t let me go to Mr. Rivers and get some expo spray stuff and some markers that I needed to do my project. becuase he didn\'t want to \"disrupt\" his class(keep that in mind). Then he whipped out this gay book that keeps me from having fun in class because it has these diagrams on overhead sheets (which means I don\'t get to draw and color them out of the book) and I was thinking, \"I don\'t want your dumb diagrams. Get away from me.\" Okay, so GET THIS. In the MIDDLE of Math class(Mr. Rivers) Mr. Walker walkers(AHAHAHAHA I crack myself up) in and yells something about a fruitcake or something. I was thinkin \"Mr. Walker!! What the heck?! You won\'t let me get markers for my project, but you TOTALLY make me lose my train of thought over a retarded fruit cake?!\" It was very retarded, I say. Life goes on. In 3rd period I don\'t remember what happened, but it probably wasn\'t fun. In fourth period my group did not do ANY WROK AT ALL, the same thing they had been doing for the last three days. Okay, now get this. I\'m had been the only one working on this project the ENTIRE time (WAIT, ESCUSE ME, Haley wrote the word presidents\' on our poster, I\'m sorry). I worked really hard to make this retarded graph and no one else did anything else. SO, I finally finish our project, and Colin and Haley said, \"Oh yeah, Russell, we\'re not going to use your graph(which was the entire project).\" I thought, \"WHAT THE CRAP?!\" You haven\'t done any work at all!! Who are you to say what we\'re going to do?!\" Anyway, that pissed me off a lot. In Computer Science, we started working on this lame volcano project and then I came home. I made some psycho killer pictures for Chuck and I\'m burning a cd for Jacob. I invited Mikey to go to Jillian\'s on the Trail\'s big night out, and I think he\'s gonna go tomorrow. The only problem is, nobody will go with me to Sharptop. I\'ve asked SO MANY people and none of them want to go, it\'s so dumb. None of them really care about it, and that I want them to go.

They all started saying all kinds of things like this is my sister\'s last visit ever. i started to get more upset and started to shed a tear or so. Eventually, they kept talking until i just couldn\'t handle it any longer. i started to cry harder. i grabbed my heaphones and pressed play. Heartbeat by Bleach played and i just started bawling. Right out in the middle of the resturaunt. i couldn\'t help it. The more i listened to the words, the harder and harder i cried. i realized that i have been hurting so much, ever since my parents left my church. It told me God was right here for me.

After we hang out we\'re gonna head over to the Tooth and Nail show at the Masquerade (with Watashi Wa, Anberlin, Emery, and mewithoutyou). It will just be Kellie and i at the concert. I wanted Chance to go, but he\'s not which REALLLLY sucks. Chance is so awesome.Hopefully, we\'ll get to do more stuff(other than math homework) together.

This morning i went to church. It was pretty cool because i didn\'t get there REALLLLY early like i usually do. i was tired though (from staying up all night talking to Kellie and Alex). It was bearable. It was fun because what Aaron said really helped me out with what i\'ve been feeling for the last two weeks or so. Also, i had a lot of fun with Kellie and Alex. Kellie, Chris, and i went to go mooch free food from the men\'s trailor (actually, i think Chris strayed somewhere else on the way) and we got a donut!!! It was yum. At the beginning of big church, i went to sit with Jacob because he was sitting alone. i think it made him feel good and that made me very happy. Then, i went back to sit with Kellie and Alex. After church we all went to Fronterra\'s (or Fontera\'s as Kellie calls it hahaha). When we were done eating, Kellie, Alex, and I went oto Kroger. We played with balls, looked at feminine products(woohoo...), and looked at flowers. I saw the PERFECT sunglasses i have been looking for but i couldn\'t get them...they were 10 bucks. We went back to sit in the car after we were done at Kroger. We went home ot Kellie\'s house and had a LOT of fun. (hehehe;-), Kellie) We went ot Bruster\'s on the way to Alex\'s house, but i didn\'t get anything. i just took ice cream from them. After that, Kellie and i just talked and then i came home. We were all really tired.\r\n\r\ni got home and got online. Soon after, some strange dude started talking to me. At first it sounded like Lee, but it also didn\'t sound like Lee. After a minute i found out it was Micah! Woohoo! We had some fun talking. He wants me to go to his and Chance\'s house, so i am realllly looking foward to that. This looks like the start of a beautiful friendship. hahahah I heard that on some Disney movie my brother was watching the other night. Anyway, that\'s my day, don\'t wear it out. I\'ll go practice my mad guitar skills (what mad guitar skills you say? yeah, i try), then i am off to bed!! Sounds really comfy. I haven\'t gotten any sleep this weekend. i went to sleep at 5:30 on Friday night and 4 last night. i need sleep. You can say that again. Oh well, i don\'t seem that tired compared to the amount of sleep i\'ve gotten. Okay so.....that\'s all. Night, buddies. Today was a very wonderful day.

At church I went to Student Life. Then I went to big church of course. Acutally, it was kinda boring, but hey, I\'m still alive, you know. Anyway, after church I went with Sherry to Moe\'s and then to Aaron\'s house. It was pretty cool. He has a piece of the Berlin Wall. That\'s awesome. We went in the basement and did this little discussion thing. It was really long, but we got to take all these cool quizes. I failed them hahaha. After that, Jacob LEFT ME which he was supposed to take me home with him.  Since I had no one to go with, Derek took me to his new house. It was awesome. It is FRICKIN HUGE. They have a basketball goal in their basement. And their deck is like a friggin tree house. We were really late to Fuel because they were watching this dumb basketball game. Derek was going comepletely NUTS. I think that was the loudest I have ever heard him scream. Not to mention highest pitched.

On Friday, the day we left, I was on the school bus on the way home and Steve starrted clapping. Soon some kid in the very front of the bus started clapping to a different beat. After that, my brother and I started in and after a minute the entire bus was clapping, everyone to a different beat. It was like stomp! It was SO AWESOME. hahaha It was hilarious, too. Anyway, I got home and when I got out my suitcase, I found inside two of my favorite shirts I have been looking for forever. Southwind and Five Iron Frenzy!! WOOOHOOO I got ready, which was pretty chaotic because I hadn\'t packed or anything. We rode in air force one on the way there which was pretty awesome instead of the lame charter bus. Air Force 1 is our new church van. It was nice and comfy. PK and I wrote this HILARIOUS and COMPLETELY random story about a yello mello and his half step brother in law. Eventually, we got there and ran around and stuff. Nothing that exciting hapened the first night. Actually, I\'m sure there was something I am just forgetful. Anyway, on to the more exciting parts. Chris was hitting on every girl in camp at one time (including our cabin) and stuff. It was interesting. That night, Jacob and PK and Levi and Natthan and I ran around being awesome. We hid under the bridge and acted like trols and whenever someone would come by, we would jump out and attack them and be like RAAAAAARRR WE\'RE TROLLS WHO GOES THERE. It was awesome. After that, we decided to play penis. We started out whispering and then eventually it turned into screaming, until you could hear like 6 guys screaming penis at the top of their lungs and hear it echo into the mountains. Not to meantion. we did it about 20 times in one night. We almost got our youth leader to play with us. We got some girls to play with us, too hahahaha. We tried doing it in the cabins, in the middle of the field, by the lake, at club, during the prayer (HAHAHAHA juuuuust kidding), and oh so many more places. We would have done it in the girls cabin too if we were allowed to go in there hahahaha. After that, we sprinted through the entire guys cabin right through the middle of everybody and screamed as loud as we could all the way down the hallway, out the door, down the stairs, back through the lower downstairs door, through the hallway, back up the other stairs, and right our the front door. hahahahah it was so hilarious. Levi is a crazy fool, gangsta. Well, it was fun hahaha.I dropped my camera though. It still  works but it\'s all screwed and the battery thing falls off all the time. hahaah That\'s what duct tape is made for. Oh yeah, and I played basketball with a frisbee. That was fun. Sorta.

I wanted to go on another bike ride. I didn\'t want to go alone this time so I asked Will and Jesse (my brother) if they want to go. They were kinda skeptic, but I got them to go. I finally found a bike I could use. I had to adjust the tires, handlebars, and put a new seat on it. That was after I tried all of our other old bikes. haha but I finally found a bike that I could use and we heaed off. Jesse and Will were ahead the whole time because they had these fast, 21 gear bikes and I had a 7 gear bike I got in 3rd grade. haha but it was still fun. We started off and Jesse started whining about it being dangerous and he was being pretty paranoid. Will kept saying he had a bad feeling about it, but I told them to be quiet and I took the lead. We stopped at the Texaco and took a rest. We drank our water and got up to leave. When we were leaving I heard someone call my name and I looked up and saw Mitch\'s mom. We talefor a second and then she left and we started off again. We crossed 316 safely and went passed Waffle House. We passes our school, the high school, and went into the park. We rode around for about a mile (one lap) and then headed stright to Micah\'s and Chance\'s house. We went past the post office, and took a right and went past Dacula Elemtary School and past some baptist church. We rode down this reeeeeeally long hill. I was thinkin \"MAN! This is gonna be IMPOSSIBLE to ride up!\" but it seemed a lot shorter on the way up. We came up to the road that I thought was theirs (I had been there before, but I wasn\'t EXACTLY sure where it was) and made sure it was theirs and headed down the road. I got nervous everytime I saw a cop car because I wasn\'t wearing a helmet and I think that\'s against the law but oh well. I was gonna put Micah\'s note in his mailbox(I made a note that said \"I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE MICAH!\" hahahah) but there was a cop  that lived across the street so I was hesitant because opening someone\'s mailbox is against the law, ya know. We rode down past Chance\'s house and for the blink of an eye I saw this guy sitting in a chair beside Chance\'s house. Before I could think (or do anything else for that matter) I screamed CHANCE! I realized it was Chance and we rode over to say hey. He was talking to Emily. I figured we would just go by his house, drop off the stalker not and leave, but Chance just HAPPENED to be outside hahaha. He said, \"I think Micah is home\" and we ran over and I got to meet Micah! Woohoo! I said something about not opening Micah\'s mailbox becuase of the cop and Chance said it was just a fat guy that ate (I just typed \"opened donuts all the time\" hahah I hate no idea why) donuts all the time. Anyway, so we talked for a while and said our goodbyes and then left. hahah Micah had just gotten home and he said that he was riding down the road and saw three guys on bikes and started to wonder hahaha, it was pretty funny. So Chance, next time you are coming to MY house! hahah It will be awesome. So yeah, I had a ton of fun today. After we came home, we ate Chinese food and it was really good. Especially after the really long bike ride. Fourteen miles...\r\n\r\nIt was awesome. We\'ll do it again sometime. I hope.... I don\'t think my parents would be happy if they found out where we went (across 316 nudge nudge).','YAY','','publish','open','open','','yay','','','2004-04-11 11:23:00','2004-04-11 11:23:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=112',0,'post','',9),(113,2,'2004-04-11 12:04:00','2004-04-11 12:04:00','Last night I spent the night at Will\'s. At one o\'clock we were getting in the bed since we have church today. I started thinkin \"Hmmm I sure could use some eggs right about now.\" I asked Will and Jesse but they wouldn\'t go make any with me. They thought I was crazy. So I was lie, screw you I\'m goin to make some eggs. His mom was alseep and everything so I didn\'t want to make any noise so  I just boiled eggs. I went and hopped back in my bag but I was scared that I was going to forget about my eggs and burn the house down hahaha. I went back and got my eggs out and the pot was shaking it was really weird. It was like there was and earthquake in Japan  or some weird deal like that. I got my eggs and put them in a cup but they were really hot so I had to wait a little while. I broke one of them and it was all deforemed and stuff. So all of a sudden Will said \"HEY! I\'m gonna take a shower!\" I was thinking okay...pyscho, but I like taking showers late at night too so you know. He got out of the shower and all of a sudden HE wanted to make some eggs. So we made eggs and I finally found some chocolate milk to drink. Will got on the computer and then his mom woke up and screamed at him. I couldn\'t get to sleep AT ALL who knows why.

It was pretty exciting. In first period, Serena and I were playing Connect Four. haha It was awesome. I WON! In second period, we started out by grading our homework. Chance answered the first question. Then I answered the second question. Then I got this bright idea. I told Chance to answer the next one, the I answered the one after that and so on hahahaha. It was hilarious. I had to think of something bad so that I would crack up hahaha. I kept getting them wrong though haha. Sounds just like me. After half of the year, I can\'t handle math anymore. Oh well, I understand it I just never get them right. During lunch, Chance and I were attacking Annie with our hairy legs hahah it was hilarious, too. I have to much fun with that awesome kid Chance hahaha. Chance put Annie\'s egg in his mouth and she gave it to him, ha. Then I licked Annie\'s chocolate egg (on the outside!!!) but she took it back. Eventually she gave it to me because she didn\'t want it since I had licked it. She gave me half of one today, too. In third period nothing really happened. Fourth period nothing happened either except Haley came to sit next to me. woohoo hahaha. Today, we had to do this debate thing in first period. It was pretty gay. I was Dan D. Lion, G. O. Logist, and the worker guy I can\'t remember what he was called. It was funny, I had to get up to debate against them building the dam, then I sat back down and they called me and I had to go back up AGAIN and debete FOR building the dam. hahah it was fun though. I got checked out in third period and found out that we got to go home for a lil bit before leaving woohoo. So now I am here scrambling to get this journal entry done with my mom yelling at me before we leave. Chaos I tell you. Actually my mom isn\'t yelling at me anymore and it isn\'t chaos.

Last week was Spring Break and I was stuck at home the whole time. The farthest I ever went was to Chance\'s house on my bike. Saturday night, at 11 o\' clock, I discovered that I had to go to my parents church for Easter. I can\'t stand that church. I came home, and then my mom told us that my grandma died a couple hours ago. That meant I had to miss half a week of school to go to her funeral. This is right after I have been sitting home all week bored out of my mind.\r\n\r\nWell, I got checked out around one on Wednesday. My mom picked us up and she told us we had to go back home for a little while because my dad needed to do something before we left. We came home and my sister was there. It was cool. We didn\'t leave until like 3 or later which made me mad because I could have stayed at school longer (it\'s not that I like work, I just had been home ALL frickin week and my house is so incredibly boring). We started driving down to Thomson, Georgia, and we all decided to go to sleep because I didn\'t have anything to do anyway. I called the backseat because it has the most room, but little did I know that my brother and sister in front of me were going to squish the POO out of me. I sat in the most uncomfortable position I have ever been in for 2 hours. I didn\'t know anybody could go without breathing for that long. We got to the hotel and my parents abandoned us! They just left us in the car and when I noticed that the stop light was geting a little long, I looked up and they were gone! I was like screw this I can barely breathe, I am NOT staying in this car. So I out on my hat and jumped out because I had some liquids that were really yearning to get out, if you know what I mean. I went in the hotel, did what I needed to, and ran right into(not literally) my parents as I was coming out. (They had gone up to check out the room.) We hopped back in the car and went to my great aunt\'s (my dad\'s aunt\'s) house. On the way, my dad was showing us all these places he had grwon up and everything it was really cool. He showed us his elementary school, his old house, where his middle school used to be where him and Mugsy, his dog, had walked through the snow when it snowed 18 inches, and other stuff like that haha. It was really cool. We got to Angie Hauser\'s house (my great aunt) and we started talkign to her and everything. MAn, I am tellin you, that is one hilarious old lady. She\'s 94 years and man, she is KICKIN. I mean she like goes all over the place and she doesn\'t even need a wheel chair or anything. My sister said somethign about what girls her age where and they started talking about TV and the media and everything. Before long this hilarious old lady started talking about boobs it was quite funny. She was like, \"Oh they know what boobs are!! They have heard that plenty on TV!\" hahaha Yeah it was hilarious. That is one funny old lady. Anyway, we hung around, I played guitar on the back porch, my dad showed his presentation for Mema (our grandma, my dad\'s mom), and all that stuff. More people came over, like our other relatives, I forgot to tell you that. We hung around there for awhile, then we went back to our hotel. We found out my uncle was rooming right next to us (he is our uncle on my mom\'s side that\'s why it was cool). He was down near Thomson for something the day before and he just stayed instead of having to drive all the way. He really likes his nephews and neices ( as in my brother and sister and I). He wanted us to do all this stuff with him it was cool. Jesse and I went in his room and watched part of some movie and thenwe went to bed. We woke up the next day around nine thirty or so and I was pretty tired, but I got up and took a shower an stuff. Then my mom brought me some breakfast from downstairs (because it was too early for me) because I had asked her to. We had to get into fancy clothes, (my mom would not stop yelling at use to do stuff. I can\'t stand going to hotels with her) and then we went down to the lobby. We talked to our relatives (everysingle person was here except for the 5 great grandchildren) for about an hour, then we headed to the funeral. I got to ride with my uncle (Tom) and he played some song for me that he had been singing all night. He said he was going to email me. I was like that\'s cool. We got to the funeral and everyone was scattered about. It was awkard. They asked me to carry to coffin. Not only me, but we all grabbed onto the handles and pulled it our of the van. It made em feel kind of weird. Everyone looking at us, even though there weren\'t all that many people. It was this big silver coffin. It was rectangular and rounded on the top. I wasn\'t really expecting anything, but if I had been, it wouldn\'t have been what I had expected it to look like. It looked sort of space aged and everything. They had the people go up that wanted to look in. I didn\'t look in it, but I stood next to it and just onlooked. It was awkward so I didn\'t want to go all the way up to see her. The guy to talk came up and everyone took a seat. I found a nice lil spot on the front row and sat down. The chairs look a lot comfier than they actually were. They were blue. The guy talked on and on about this stuff, he wasn\'t very good, but it was okay. My family didn\'t like it either, we had a discussion about it. After that, I jumped back into Tom\'s car and we headed over to my dad\'s church, where he grew up in, to have the memorial service. We went in, my dad set his presentation on his laptop up in the front of the church for people to watch and we went into the chapel and sat down. The same guy came up and talked. He did pretty much the exact same talk as he did earlier, but it was as boring because I coulld rest my head on the pew, and i got to sit with my sister. We got out of the service finally and I was STARVING but my mom could really care less. Luckily, my dad understood and he was like yeah, I am NOT going to wait until 5 (for the big dinner) to eat, so he gave us money to go to KFC. That was pretty aweosme. Also, Jimmy Hauser, Angie Hauser\'s son, gave us some brownies. That was cool, too. We sat around at the church for a couple hours until the dinner. My dad took us around and showed us all the stuff he used to do and where he would go for church and all that stuff. We went to dinner and I took a walk  around the church and listened to Holland so I ended up getting to dinner aftert they had already started. Listening to Holland reminded me of last Thanksgiving. It was sad sort of, but also very happy. I didn\'t want to go to Tulsa (in Oklahoma) for Thanksgiving, but it was the last time we were going to get to go there and one of the last things to do with my sister. It was a bittersweet week. I like it but it was sort of broing. I listened to music a lot and reflected. I did that in Thomson the last couple of days, too. I don\'t really know what to think about my grandma dying. I won\'t really miss her, since I wasn\'t around her that long, but looking at the pictures it made me sad. It made me want to do more stuff with her, because I never really got to do anything except for when I was little. We saw her all the time then. I came to dinner and didn\'t really have anywhere to sit. The table my family was at was full, so I sat with Stephen, Laurie, and my uncle Ernie\'s family. I wasn\'t that hungry because i had KFC, but i had a little bit of green beans and ham and a roll. After the dinner, we talked for a little and took pictures (it was the first time the entire family was together, except Mema) and eventually we left to go back to the hotel. We hung around for a little bit and changed and stuff and talked about the service, etc. I changed into jeans, put on my hat, and went across the street to buy some milk at the Racetrac. I came back and we all went down  to the lobby again. I brought the Lucky Charms and the milk and a bowl and sppon and sat down at one of the tables. I sat down and opened the Lucky Charms (it was brand new, unopened) and started eating. When I was done, there weren\'t any lucky charms left. I guess I was hungry. Later that night, we went to Dairy Queen with Linsey, Shelley, and my brother and I. I got an oreo blizzard. I got a dime in that little thing where you drop a cion in the water and get it in the cup, but it had to be a quarter. I saw condoms in the gas station it was connected to and it made me feel bad. It made me think about all the sin and stuf in the world and how people get addicted to drugs and they can\'t afford it finaccially so they go into stuff like prostitution and everything. I wondered how much they costed, but didn\'t want to draw attention to them. I just noticed them as I was walking by. We got back in the car and went back to the hotel. We went in the lobby because my parents were at Wal-Mart and they had the key. Lindsey, my brother, and I talked for a long time then we went to the front desk and got a key for our room. We went up there and about 2 minutes later, our parents showed up. It was kind of annoying cause we were in the lobby for about half an hour waiting for them. It was kind of funny though. Lindsey hung around for a little while in our room and we watched the Cosby Show and stuff. I LOVE that show. It\'s the only show on TV worth watching. It\'s hilarious. Lindsey left after awhile, and we all got inot bed. We talked for a long time about the bad stuff we had done and our dad told us stories about when he was small and stuff like that. Evetually, They ticked me off and I was like screw you and i put on my headphones. The next morning my brother was yellign at us to wake up and being a huge pain in the butt and decided that (ONLY because I started it!!!) he was going to start guitar. Luckily, I don\'t think he\'ll hold up to it, and if he does, he won\'t be able to play anything so it\'s okay. He plays drums anyway. We did that whole deal about my mom yellin at us for like an hour while we were packing and everything. We got packed, and went to Angie Hausers to eat. We hung around just like we had been doign the whole time and ate. We left and then went to the grave one last time to see her after they buried her. We talked about her will and what we were gonna do to our own bodies and how it should be up to your relatives since you\'re dead and it doesn\'t matter. Then we got in the car and headed home. I got in the front this time. We went to an Ingles so that my mom and sister could get some stuff for cookies. They made them a little while I think.

Yesterday, we rode around at the park. Trebble Mill, I\'m not going back that was so boring. We only went 6 miles...lame, but for some reason I was SO tired. I think it\'s because all of the ups and downs. After we came home, we got pizza, I helped Will with photoshop(the thing I made was cool until he screwed it up), then I went back my house to get ready for a night on the town. Changed clothes and stuff, used my bo stick, etc, then turned up Emery all the way. A few minutes later Tait got here and we were off. I helped them out a little with getting there, but we got there fine. We went to Lifeway first, Tait get\'s 95% off of everything with his youth leader carder(hahahah well that\'s what HE said). We went in the sound booths and listened to a little Living Sacrifice (on full blast I might add). We checked out all the awesome CDs and headed for the checkout. I asked them about the Five Iron Frenzy CD but they said they didn\'t know if they would have it or not(comes out Tuesday - everybody go buy it). Did you know all CDs come out on Tuesdays? Tait got this cool U2 CD with covers by people like Delirious?, Chris Tomlin, Pillar, Sanctus Real, Grits(hahah it\'s true), and other cool folks. We made like a baby and headed out to the mall.  We strolled through Galyans, played a little golf (hahah okay well not exactly), and then got into the mall. We walked around and made it to the food court and the movie place. I only saw one or two people I knew, I was surprised. We decided not to see a movie and went down to eat. After we ate, we went sandal shopping and they called me ADD for looking at all the stuff in the stores. We went through Galyans, play a little Lacrosse (wow those things are way too expensive), and then left. We went to Bruster\'s on the way to Jacob\'s. There was this mysterious lady that ordered ice cream and then left. We figured she was seeing who could order the most food and the leave. hahaha It was quite funny. We went to Jacob and made AWESOME Flash movies. Then I went home. Then I couldn\'t get to sleep so I made that other entry. yeah.\r\n\r\nToday was okay. Just like always. This morning I was all mad and sad and everything because of being tired of being dumb and because I had a missions meeting and all that crapizzle. It got sort of better when I got to big church. Okay well not really. I felt better after the meeting. I went to Jacob\'s house and we got a Goldeneye tournament goin on with Jacob, Josh, Jason, and I. It was awesome. We decided that if you pick random level, it automacally chooses caves. Man that level is so freakin dark you can\'t see anything. Luckily we were playing with paintball mode and lasers so I just used my laser to direct me by shooting the walls and if the paintball shows up then there\'s a wall there. hahahahha After that, I drew a violent picture, mugged some of the Harkey\'s popcorn, and we played assassin the president or somethign like that. I hand cuffed him and shot him with a duck hunt gun (\\\\m//). We went to Fuel and we had to pick up Froni on the way. We honked the horn like a thousand times and he finally came out. We had to pack ourselves into the back. We were doing the wave and then Tim started doing it and yeah it was aweosme. Then we started moshing to Everyday Sunday. That was aweosme too. Then we got to Fuel. Then we went to Wendy\'s. Then I mooched money to but food since my parents only gave me 30 cents to eat. Then I went home. After the meeting, my day was awesome, so yeah. \r\n\r\nGod Speed','Two days','','publish','open','open','','two-days','','','2004-04-18 08:42:00','2004-04-18 08:42:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=130',0,'post','',2),(131,2,'2004-04-18 10:54:00','2004-04-18 10:54:00','LAST PERSON WHO..\r\nx Slept in your bed: me luckily\r\nx Made you cry: psh I do not know that\r\nx You shared a drink with: Kellie\r\nx You went to the movies with: I don\'t remember\r\nx You went to the mall with: Tait and Jacob, it was awesome\r\nx Yelled at you: I don\'t know\r\nx Sent you a comment on Livejournal: Karyn\r\nx Said they were going to kill you: I\'m sure it was Jacob\r\n\r\nHAVE YOU EVER..\r\nx Gotten in a fight: What kind of ghetto bootay do I look like?\r\nx Been to New York? um....yes\r\nx Been to Florida? yes\r\nx Been to California? no\r\nx Been to Hawaii? no\r\nx been to Mexico? no\r\nx been to Jamaica? no\r\nx Been to Canada?

Before the Battle of Little Big Horn, he turned to some of his chiefs and he said, \'Today is a good day to die.\' And today is a good day to die....  In the Bible there\'s a story of the prophet Elijah. At the end of his life, he takes down his cloak, and he hands it to the person that he has taught his whole life, Elisha. He gives him his cloak with the blessing to carry twice the grace that he has been given...twice the faith...that he would do twice as much. So tonight, this is what is happening to you. We\'re passing this mantle down. The good thing\'s within. Remember that God loves you. Remember that all he requires of you is to love him with all your heart and to love others as yourself. We\'re gonna sing one more song, and you guys can go home. Hopefully we\'ll see some of you tomorrow. We\'ll see you around though one day anyway. This might seem stupid but it\'s snowing out side.

I was at Will\'s last night. I was online a bit and I talked to Erica and her crazy cousin. I decided to draw a picture of Erica but it made her look really ugly hahaha. I don\'t think she liked it. Hey, cool I just got my brother to bring me my cd\'s online. That\'s awesome. Okay, so I\'ll put in FIF probably. I\'m listening ot Mae right now, but I don\'t have that cd yet, darn. It\'s awesome. Listen to it. Anyway, yeah, I talked to Erica and other people that I don\'t remember and then we were gonna go outside side to sleep in our sleeping bags, but Will was bein a really big wuss and wouldn\'t come out with us so Jesse and I were like screw you and we went out there hahahhaha. A little while later, the house lights started flashing and Will came out to join us. I went in to get some cheez-its and these chocolate things. I gave one to Jesse and Will stole the other one even though I licked it since I didn\'t ask. It made me mad. Then we got bored so I went streaking around the yard, it was fun. Then we played slaps or whatever you call it and I beat Jesse and Will like crazy. Then Deborah came out and we were like what the crap? Then we heard Steven talking to his horses. Yeah. Jesse woke me up by whacking me and then Will\'s crazy dog came and got mud on my pillow, hair on my bag, and tried to get in the sleeping bag with me. It was crazy. We went in (it was about 7:30. I could have slept a long time because my head was in my sleeping bag-nice and dark- if my brother had been a poo face.) and washed our pillows and dryed our sleeping bags from the dew and the dog hahaha. Then I talked to my mom about the Emery show tomorrow night. I can\'t wait. Chance, Micah, Ryan, Chuck, Jacob, and I are all gonna rock it out. \\\\m//\r\nI found out my charger for my laptop came back and I went YESSSSS *and did the arm chaching thing*. hahaha I haven\'t been on my laptop in forever, so I was like sweet and I came out here on the back porch (well it\'s not really a porch, more like a garden) and got my headphones. I sat down turned some awesome tunes on and I\'ve been reading everybody\'s journals. hahaha I\'ve been out here for a couple of hours. and I\'m still not done hahaha. Anyway, I\'ve had an awesome day and I\'m going to Erica\'s tonight. I don\'t know how it will turn out, but I\'m sure it will be great (even though Brittany Thayer will be there.....great). I haven\'t up dated in a while, I\'m sorry. My image hosting is down for the month so the picture are gone, I\'ll need to get resituated, sorry about that. \r\n\r\nMy dad got me a guitar yesterday just out of no where I was like woah that\'s awesome pops. It\'s a Jasmine, I\'m sure it\'s not \"good\" but they all sound the same to me. I was playin for a long time last night but my fingers started hurting because I haven\'t played in a while. So now I\'m just out in my little garden area journaling and listening to Switchfoot. Awesome. The sun went behind a cloud so it\'s nice and cool and I can see the screen.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, the last Five Iron CD came out Tuesday it makes me sad. I wish I could see just another show. Oh well, it\'s so awesome that they got their last show on tape. \r\n\r\nI went to Hebron with Chance Wednesday. It was so awesome. We went to this truck back in the woods, then we went to church and there were all these krunk people it was rad. There were people talking behind us and Chance threw paper in their face, it was quite humorous. I took all kinds of cool picture and I realized that I lost my AA battery charger so now I have to buy a new one for like 30 bucks and it made me mad, but it\'s all for a reason, I know. At the end, Ryan and I put in Five Iron and DANCED like MAD CRAZY. hahaha it was so much fun. Then Garrick and Chance and Micah danced with us, then we moshed, then I saw Lindsey over in the middle of nowhere moshing by herself it was quite interesting. Then we rocked it out on the way hoem because Chance\'s parents are cool and turned FIF up really loud. Then we took crazy pictures. hahaha oh yeah, before we left we were looking on Kevin\'s phone and we saw this person named Bow Wow in the address book but he didn\'t really know who it was, so Lindsey decided to call him and then I took the phone and was like hey dude what\'s up? Are you a rapper? and stuff like that it was aweosme. Then that stupid guy decided to call back and cuss that cool kid Kevin out and I coulda given him some tude and showed him who\'s boss, but you know, I wasn\'t there. That stinks.\r\n\r\nSo, now we\'re pretty much up to date, I\'ll talk to you guys later.\r\n\r\n\r\nPS If you have like 14 bucks or so, go buy the Five Iron Frenzy CD \"The End is Here\".

It was fun. Karyn and the Brittanys and Stuart came. All those other kids I was like Wha? I don\'t know you! You\'re <i>awesome</i> Erica, thanks for asking me to come, I had a great time hanging out with you.\r\n\r\nThe controversial part comes up. They watch this movie about Texas and Chainsaws and stuff. Hearing the word chainsaw in the title I figured it was R and I was like CRAAAAP. I didn\'t want to watch it. But I DID want to go. I\'m not yelling at Erica or anything, but that movie was HORRIBLE. First of all, I don\'t enjoy hearing F YOU YOU FING FER every 2 seconds and second of all, I don\'t enjoy seeing completely DISGUSTING things all OVER the screen. The media is absolute and complete filth and seeing this makes me shudder at the amount of all the sin in the world. Satan came to steal, kill, and destroy, and it is horrible. I can\'t stand it. The things our youth is put through these days are insane. I\'m appauled at it. I can\'t believe it, and I can\'t stand it. It\'s gross. Really gross. It makes me sad. \r\n\r\nAnyway, all that I saw tonight reminded me of this picture I made a couple months ago. I love it. I shows just how screwed up the world is and how entagled in it\'s own sin it can get, yet all we need is God and it is COMPLETELY purged away to nothing. Purity. Without God, the world is lost and confused, and screws up everything. It saddens me to see all these psychotic things and I think  \"Why can\'t they see?\" They need God. And without God people just do things like that.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://img38.photobucket.com/albums/v118/BuddyofSponge/LiveJournal/Mankind_is_Dark.jpg\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\nSorry Erica for ranting.

And comment. Oh well, maybe I should stop neglecting my own. Such laziness. Well, I\'ve always been lazy so it doesn\'t really matter. Yeah, so I was messin around with photoshop and I changed my journal. The icon is from when I went swimming with Will the other day. It seems like he has his pool opened much earlier this year. Maybe I just don\'t have as much desire to swim this year. Out of Jesse, Will, and I, i\'m always the last one to agree to swim, and the first to get out. It just feels so boring. Oh well, I got some cool pictures. The background is from when I looked at the sky and it was really neat. So I took a picture (yes, I always have my camera with me). I was in Will\'s driveway. I like it. I like all of them. Who knows when I will get tired of this one. I get tired of all the others. Oh well, I like it. \r\n\r\nI believed in what I hoped for,\r\nAnd I hope in things unseen,\r\nI had wings and dreams could soar,\r\nI just don\'t feel like flying anymore\r\n\r\nToday was the last day of school. It was kinda weird. Can\'t really say how. It didn\'t feel like the end. I know I will still see everyone. I am crazy though. When I got off the bus my mom was up on the porch singing or something. It was kind of strange. Seems like she\'s more excited about it than us. I ate or something like that, then Garrick called. He wanted to know if I was going to go to the mall with them. Davis was goign to go to the pool instead. Chance was going to baseball. I felt it kind of pointless. I found out Garrick went anyway with someone else, it made me feel bad. Not for me, but him. I called Will and headed over to his house. I forgot that I had told Melissa I would call her back in 5 minutes. I don\'t know how that happened, I\'m always thinking of her. Oh well, I called her back like a long time later and found out she was at Micah\'s game. Micah was on first base so I wanted her to tell him that I said hey but she wouldn\'t because she\'s a bully. I told her to call me back when the game was over so I could talk to him but she didn\'t. It made me sad. \r\n\r\nLord, search my heart,\r\nCreate in me something clean,\r\nDandelions, You flowers in these weeds\r\n\r\nAfter talking to her, we installed the sims and I played that while Will watching that dumb American Idol show. Melissa kept setting our house on fire. It reminded me of when Chance and I were playing and people would come to our house, pee in the road, then have seisures. It was weird. I kept having to buy new ovens. Then I threw the fireman in the pool. It was quite amusing. Eventually, I went home and my dad got all ticked off for me being on the phone past nine on a summer night, so it made me mad and I was like screw you I\'m getting online. So I\'m here now. After that, I had to take out the trash. I guess it didn\'t matter that it was 11 o\'clock at night. My brother took out one this morning. I had to take out 4. It made me mad. It was fun anyway though, so it didn\'t matter. I\'m already enjoying my summer on the first night.\r\n\r\nHere\'s my heart,\r\nLet it be forever Yours,\r\nOnly You can make every new day seem so new\r\n\r\nI was calling Jacob all night to see if he could come over, but I could never get him. Chance couldn\'t either because his mom wouldn\'t let him. Hopefully, they can both come over tomorrow night. Jacob told me there is an Awkward Romance concert at Crossroads tomorrow at 6 for free. Hopefully we\'re going to that. I don\'t want to miss Hebron but oh well. That is every week.\r\n\r\nI\'m sorry I haven\'t been updating you guys on everythign lately. It\'s just that I\'m not allowed to use the computer, so I\'ve been journaling in my real journals. If you ever see me with one of them you can read it. Anyway, nothing big has really happened. My sister is in the Czech Republic. I hope things are going well for her there. She mailed of two cents. It was kinda cool. And the two ticket things but I didn\'t bother to read it so I didn\'t really know what they were. I\'m lazy. I haven\'t even read her emails. And she\'s my favorite person. They are long. \r\n\r\nI have a missions trip next week. I really have no idea what it will be like. I\'m just glad because it will be fun with Jacob. And the Joshes. And the other guys. I\'m not expecting anything. I probably am. I just don\'t know it. Pray for me.\r\n\r\nMy Lord, how long to sing this song? \r\nAnd my Lord, how muchmore of this pretending to be strong?\r\n\r\nI\'ve been listening to mewithoutyou tonight. They are awesome. When I heard them live I didn\'t like it at all. They\'re speaking french in this song. Bullet to Binary.\r\n\r\nI know I said nothing big has happened but whoops. We had a wedding at our house. It was good. It was POURING. There was a huuuge thunderstorm. Luckily, by the time the wedding came, that evening, all there were was white clouds. I got to invite Melissa. It was fun. \r\n\r\nI\'m running out of things to say. If it doesn\'t come out without forcing it, there\'s no reason to write it. That\'s kind of what I\'ve been doing in my real journal. I think it\'s just because it\'s almost finished. \r\n\r\n\r\nI talk to you guys later.\r\nYou can email me.

Only Micah, Chuck, and I. Ashley and Lindsey are going to come, too.\r\n\r\nIt is WAAAY too late. I need sleep. Well, so far this summer, I went to DC for a missions trip. Other than that, I\'ve been asking people to come over almost every night and not even one has come over yet. Not very encouraging to my self-esteem if you ask me. I\'ve just been sitting at home all day long play Harvest Moon. Not my idea of fun (the sitting at home part- I love Harvest Moon). Finally, Micah is spending tomorrow night after the concert. It will be way late anyway, so maybe we\'ll get some sleep and have a good morning. He is getting here tomorrow morning at 12. It shall be fun.\r\n\r\nI was very lonely, so I couldn\'t really take it any longer. That\'s why I got on. It\'s been hard. 171 down. It will be 191 by tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nGuys, seriously, call me to do something. It\'s so dull being stuck in this house. I would ride my bike somewhere, but I can\'t cross 316. Yesterday, I rode right by a big snake on the road. It was really scary. I didn\'t know it was a snake until really close. I saw another super big one a minute or two later, but luckily it had gotten hit by a car. This is on my bike by the way.\r\n\r\nI had a lot of stuff to say earlier, but I vented it all out to myself so now it\'s gone. Sorry.

I woke up at 1:18. After I got up, I wandered around a little, ate something, then headed out to mow the grass. I found out that I had filled the mower with kerosene last time (not good) so we had to do all this crap then go get gas and everything. Eventually I got it mowed and everything. \r\n\r\nBy the way, I\'ve been at Atlanta Fest for the last few days. Aaron acted really dumb when I told him. I don\'t like him. My faith is not his buisnass. Now Tait is a different story. He is awesome, I wish we could talk more. Anyway, I bought a bunch of CDs and feel really spoiled even though I earned all of the money working but I still feel spoiled for some reason. I got the new Supertones CD so it\'s all good.\r\n\r\nI mowed the grass so now 234 down, about 120 to go. After I mowed, I went to Mitch\'s house because it was my first chance to go see him since he got back (4 days ago - Tuesday). It was awesome. He hasn\'t changed. A little rough at first, but it was great. I walked there because my front tire to my bike was busted (I think from when Chuck and I went to the falls) and searched all over and none of them seemed to be home, so I headed back home. I said to myself, \"Self, there is still hope, you might see them drive by on the way home.\" I really did think that because it has happened quite a few times. As I was breasting (ha! I couldn\'t help myself, that seriously is a real way to use that word) the last hill, just about to make to my road, I saw a black truck turn. My heart jumped. Their truck is so reckonizable. Not only because it is unique (big black harley pickup truck with flames on the side. not huge ones just little line things), but also because I have riden in it so many times. As they got closer I saw it was them (even though I knew it was them the second they turned the corner) and I was so excited, yet still paniced because I didn\'t know what they (Mitch and his dad- Mitch\'s dad is awesome. He almost just as much a friend as Mitch is) would do or say. I told him I had gone to their house and they weren\'t there and they said they went to my house on the way home and neither of us were home and then said \"Hop in!\" Mitch\'s hair a REALLY a lot longer. We got back and scooped poop. I brought a bathing suit since he has a pool and asked him if he wanted to swim and he did (enthusiastically which surprised me, not that he doesn\'t like swimming or anything) so we went swimming. First thing, we saw a frog so we got him. We played with him the whole hour and a half or however long it was that we swam. His name was Angus. I wanted to name him Hubert, though. Mitch\'s dad came out and asked us if we wanted to go to Waffle house, so that\'s what we did. It was a regualr thing we do. None of you really know about Mitch, but he has been one of my best friends ever since the missions trip to New York we went on two years ago. I haven\'t said anything about him because ever since I\'ve had this journal, he\'s been in California, living with his biological family. He\'s going back because he hates it here and loves it there but it\'s okay because I know we will pick up exactly where we left off. It was so much fun hahahaha the entire night I was like \"Hey sponge Buddy (that\'s what we call each other, it\'s where my screen name came from if you didn\'t know that-Sponge Buddy was taken) remember when we did this and this and this and this and this?\" hahahahah there were SO many things that came back to me. After he leaves and comes back again I\'m goign to say \"Hey Sponge Buddy, remember when I came over and we swam and had Angus and divorced and everything\" hahahahahhah I think Angus got tired of getting chucked across the pool and being a circus frog and doing the high dive and escaping from prison and swimming hahahahah. When we got out he was either really comfortable with us holding him or really tired. ha, Mitch hasn\'t changed ONE bit. I love him. \r\n\r\n\r\nhahaha \r\n\r\nTime for bed. I have to wake up early tomorrow. Three and a half hours of sleep, here I come. I love all of you guys. Call me today(Sunday), Chance.

It was great fun. We played Vice City forever. We stayed up all night so I can\'t remember much. At like 5, I heard this noise, and when I listened, I realized my parents alarm was going off. Then I remember that they were getting up at 5 to take my brother to the airport for camp. SO we ran upstairs and made a bed on my floor and waited. Eventually my mom came up and woke my brother up and we had to wait for them to leave to come out because it was too late to go to sleep, we would end up sleeping all day. So we talked about Signs and other stuff. It was very fun. Then we went back downstairs and played Vice City. Then he left at 6:20 and I went to Sugarloaf. We went to Chick fil a afterwards where I tried to steal eveyones food but no one would let then finally Rainey gave me a dollar and I got to go get ice cream. YAY! Derek and Jacob came over after that. On the way home Jacob and I listened to our hardcore music and we introduced Derek to Norma Jean. He liked it. It was quite funny. We got home and played with fire and Derek just sat on his butt and wouldn\'t help us at all, only messed us up and tried to catch my pants on fire. Then they made fun of me for my parents leaving Sugarloaf. Then we went in and play Vive City and I layed down and fell alseep because I hadn\'t gotten any sleep in 54 hours. Tait came to pick Jacoob up which was very cool and then Derek left soon after and Sherry had to drag him out by his ears. Then I mowed the grass. I feel like going to eat with my friends at Subway or somewhere. My parents are taking me to a movie tonight. I don\'t want to go but I will. I will have fun. My uncle wants me to go to my grandparents tomorrow for the parade (the foursth is on a Sunday so they\'re having it on the third). I want to go. He is so cool, it\'s just awkward. I am almost done! 44$ left. Melissa wants me to go to their grandparents on the fourth, too. I want to go to that also. Monday, we leave for Fort Walton. Yippee. I will sit alone.

It wasn\'t fun. Then I went to church it ATL like always. Then we went to a weird grocery store to get lunch. It was good. After that, we went to get A NEW BIKE! I was so YAY!! It is cool. Black. I had to get a helmet, too. Bleh. I usually ride this little bike I got in third grade, but my brother, Will, and I or whoever is riding with me usually go about ten miles or so, so my dad said I could get a new one. It\'s not a mountian bike but it\'s not a road bike. It\'s kinda like a granny bike. Anyway, I got home and went riding instead of mowing the grass. I was going along and I thought I went by  Mary\'s house but I was wrong. She said right left not left right. Then I went and I saw this school. The cafeteria had exploded or something and when i got closer, I realized it was Harbins. I was like WHAT THE CRAP I went a million miles away from home and all of a sudden am by the school right next to me. It was so weird. Then I went on THE BIGGEST FREAKIN HILL I\'VE SEEN IN MY LIFE. No really. You should see it. It was cool though. Then I went by Kristen\'s house. After I passed he rhouse, I saw these two old people. I kept staring at them and they never moved at ALL. They were in the garden looking at the ground. I swear they were very realistic scarecrows. Then, I made it to Mitch\'s. So we played a bit. Then we looked for Geoffrey. He was gone. Poop. Then I finally went home. It was fun. I think it was about 10 miles but I\'m not sure.\r\n\r\nAfter that, I got ready and went to Hebron for the Fort Walton thing. Geoffrey wasn\'t there. The movie was lame. It wasn\'t funny or cool or good or anything. Oh well. I loved seeing my friends. It was short lived. I came home and mowed to grass until dark. That way, it will be way faster and easier tomorrow. I am going to a movie and lunch or something like that tomorrow with Mitch and Sugarloaf in the morning. Then I will finish off the grass, then I will go to Bible study in the evening. \r\n\r\n\r\nReally, call me. I never get calls. I would love it. I will answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI love you. I really do. \r\n\r\n\r\nI don\'t know, mai.

It was ssssUPER fun. She said that she had a piano lesson when I was leaving around 1:40. I was like pooop because I would only get to stay for about half an hour. So, we\'re swimming for awhile and I realize it has been way, way longer than thirty minutes. I discovered that it wasn\'t Mary\'s lesson, it was her little sister\'s, Erica. So I\'m like \"It\'s coo, it\'s coo.\". Her mom had already taken her sister and she let me stay because her brother and sister were with us. We went inside and started making dinner and stuff because she had to do that. It reminded me of the time I almost caught the kitchen on fire, which wasn\'t very long ago. Afterwards, she played piano for me, on which I will say she is absolutely marvelous. I couldn\'t believe it. Anyway, she got her little brother\'s guitar which didn\'t go too smoothely. It was out of tune so I didn\'t really know what to do. She seemed to understand somewhat. We finished making dinner and stuff and we went outside, I don\'t even remember what for, but I ended up fixing the seat of her bike and pumping up her tires. Random. It was so funny, she was just riding around with totally flat tires. I must say though, that was one heck of a workout. Then she noticed the thing wasn\'t in the tire all of the way, so it ended up being a lot easier than how it seemed. I had ridden my bike to her house. Her older sister had tried to get her drivers license that day and failed so she was piiiiissssssed. I thought she was going to murder me. It made me feel bad for Mary because she was being so nice to her nonetheless. Her dad came hoem so I met him, and then left again. We went to see the chickens it was so ROCKIN. I wish I had chickens. We also went into the little loft thing which was SO cool. It had a tin roof, so I dreamed of coming out on a rainy winter night and sleeping there. It would be so cool. After that, we looked at picture because there were like a trillion of them. They had gone to Wyoming. She has the most talkative little sister I have ever met. We ate dinner and stuff and I helped clean up. Dinner was so noisy (there are 7 kids and two parents) hahaha it was so much fun. We went outside and tried to talk for a bit, but all 25 of her little siblings were attacking us and wouldn\'t leave us alone. Eventually they started talking about poop and stuf so we told them to run through the field to see who could be the best indian so they all ran screaming through the field. It was the most hilarious thing I had seen all week. I swear her little brother John is ADD. For those of you who were at Starlight with us, he was the one attacking us.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://img3.imgspot.com/u/04/195/05/RyanandJohn.JPG\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEventually, we made a run for the truck to hide in the bed of the truck. Surprisingly (right), they found us in about 15 seconds. Then we ran inside and back out onto the deck and yet again, they all followed. Then Mary got her parents attention and they got them away. Then of course, John went outside and around up the stairs and all and his dad yelled at him. Then he found a secret door leading out onto the deck and we thought next he was going to repel out of a window. It was okay though because we got to talk. Her mom came out and told us her sister and her boyfriend were watching a movie downstairs. So, we went down there and started watching it with them. It was Zoolander. We watched it for a few minutes, and she obviously was uncomefortable. It was PG-13. I didn\'t think it was too bad, but eventually she told me that she wanted to watch a different movie. That definaetly makes me look up to her. I wish I had the same innocence and bravery as her. Even though it was only in front of her sister, I still look up to her. So we went up stairs and started watching a different movie, but then my mom called and yelled at me for staying so late. It was dark, so she yelled at me. Luckily, they took me home and they only talked to me for five minutes. \r\n\r\n\r\nI had a <i>wonderful</i> day.

It was my mom. I don\'t remember what happened after that, but later on my family excluding Melissa, and Will went on a bike ride. I had  ridden everyday this week so I went back early. I went by Mary\'s house. I didn\'t want a workout, just a warm up. Then, I got back I was tired like crazy. I went about 4 miles. Not much. Then I talked to Kellie for a long time which was weird.

They were riding bikes to the waterfall. They were riding up the road and they saw a horse. It was running like crazy through Mike\'s field and was all beat up and gross from barbed wire. So they told Mike and got him under control and all.\r\n\r\nAfter they made it all the way down to the waterfall and everything, they were walking along and suddenly they turned around and, out of nowhere, about 100 feet back, they saw a white Jeep in the creek struggling to get to them. The guy in it stopped and yelled, \"Hey guys, come on! I\'ll give you a ride. I won\'t hurt you! It\'s okay,\" and they took off. I told them that he was a butt raper. When they were on the way home, they had to go through a neighborhood, so they were riding along through the street. Suddenly, a huge dog ran out and started chasing them. It was a doberman. It was a super fighting ninja radioactive doberman, too, just like this:\r\n<img src=\"http://img4.imgspot.com/u/04/199/20/d.jpg\">\r\n\r\n\r\n....okay well maybe not, but if I were telling the story that\'s what I would say. But yeah, it chased them and it was a big scary dog. It chased them all the way up the hill, then turned around and went back. After they got home, them and my parents were all going to ride to Tribble Mill park. After going a few miles, I decided to turn at a fork in the road because I had ridden tons all week long. When they all got back, they told me that they took a rest for a few minutes, and as they started again, they were riding along and there was a wreck that had happened just two miuntes earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt just shows that God has really been protecting all of us. Had I not been riding all week, I wouldn\'t have taken the other road and gone home, and I could have caused them to keep going for just a few minutes and gotten into a wreck. Everything happens for a reason. I\'m so glad God has been watching over all of us.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn America it\'s wonderful,\r\nAll you have to do is fake it.\r\nOwn anything you want,\r\nAll you have to do is take it.\r\nLive for today, don\'t think about tomorrow,\r\nHave a good time in America-Gomorrah.\r\n\r\n\r\nLast night we stayed up really late talking about scary stuff and dangerous stuff and how one tiny thing can change anything and all that stuff. Will and Jesse got mad at me because I started talking about Signs. \r\n\r\n\r\nToday, we went to church (not like we ever don\'t), and I forgot my Bible. It made me sad. It\'s not like it\'s unholy or anything to not bring your Bible to church, it\'s just I don\'t like that church, but I love my Bible, and I need something to do during it. Anyway, we came home and my dad wanted to find one of those new QT\'s, so we went to like 5 or 6 QT\'s on the way home from church. I got one of those things where you make a milkshake. It was lame. And very expensive. I wouldn\'t suggest it to anyone. But it\'s okay. Because I didn\'t pay for it. mwahahaha! So we finally got home, and I step out of the car and stand there for a second because, if you don\'t know me, I like to take my time. Very slow, there was no reason to rush. It\'s not like there was anyone online waiting for me to come home and get on. :-(  \r\nYeah, so anyway, I stood there for a second and I heard a bug, and suddenly the back of my left arm, below my shoulder started stinging like caaaRAZY. A stupid wasp stung me. I was just standing there. It made me mad.\r\nI HOPE IT \r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://img4.imgspot.com/u/04/199/21/Dies.jpg\">\r\n\r\n\r\nI went inside and told my mom and she started FREAKIN out.

It was distressing but it was cool. Look at it. <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/~edens_grief\">look</a> It rained I love rain. Chance went out to get the mail. I was tired so I stayed here. I called my mommy and then sat down and ate the chex mix stuff from the farmers market. Then, all of a sudden, I realized thatChance had been gone a really long time. The driveway was long, so I didn\'t think about it rigth away. SO i went to his rescue. But he was okay; he was waiting for the mail. So after we did his journal, we decided to go to town, which we wanted to do for the last few days. We walked down and yeah. It wasn\'t far at all. I wish I had brought my bike out here. It would be so COOOL. First, we went to the freedom gas station or something like that, and I got crazy glue and finger nail clippers. We tried to get a lighter but we couldn\'t. Then, we head to the Food LION! Rar! It\'s really a lot less vicious than you\'d think. Except for their coconuts. They really are vicious. SO, we went in and got chocolate milk. I love chocolate milk. When we got home, Chance told me that it was actually a chcolate drink, but they don\'t have me fooled. We also got a coconut. We named him Martin. We were walking back, and suddenly, he started leaking. We figured it was normal. Even though it smelled bad. I don\'t smell coconuts often, so I figured it was normal. We trekked through the woods and fought the giant spiders. Well, actually they were just normal size, but you know. Since we had gone on a wild adventure together, we decided that our chocolate milk was hardcre chocolate milk. We finally made it back, and drained Martin. Then we cracked him open. We couldn\'t do it with the chisel, so we just dropped him. It was Chance\'s idea. I decided to try some of the cocnut milk, even though it smelled gross, and it was THE GROSSEST thing I have ever had in my life. I would drink an entire glass of salt water before drinking half a glass of that stuff. We took it to Chance\'s aunt and she told us it was rotten and I thought NO WONDER!! Chance doesn\'t like cocnuts so he didn\'t try any of it. We took it back to the Fod Lion (rar!) and got it exchanged. This time, I decided to get some cheese along with the other cocnut. Gouda. It was super good. I still have a lot less. I also got a NINJA WARRIOR! He is so COOOOL. I made him a surf board out of coins with my crazy glue. It\'s rockin. Since it was kinda hard to eat my cilinder of cheese, we decided to go to McDonald\'s and get a knife to eat it with. Chance liked it. Even though he doesn\'t like cheese. There was a white afro guy working in there. It was neato. We went back and cracked open the cocnut again. It didn\'t smell as gross, and the milk was more clear, so we figured it was okay. I ate a little. We showed Chance\'s mom and aunt and they said it was still bad so we threw it away. Those Groovy Nuts just aren\'t any good. So we were the like \"WhAt ThE hEcK eVeR\" and went to eat mexican. Then we went to eat mexican.\r\n\r\nyram eulb ybab\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have listened to this song so many times it\'s not even funny.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Giving','','','publish','open','open','','226','','','2004-07-22 23:27:00','2004-07-22 23:27:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=226',0,'post','',0),(227,2,'2004-07-23 14:55:00','2004-07-23 14:55:00','<img src=\"http://www.terranova.net/content/images-leehman/Scary-Larry.jpg\">','','','publish','open','open','','227','','','2004-07-23 14:55:00','2004-07-23 14:55:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=227',0,'post','',0),(228,2,'2004-07-23 22:17:00','2004-07-23 22:17:00','I was playing Harvest Moon and I ran out of chicken feed. Crap. Then this old stupid guy came and took my horse away and said that I wasn\'t taking care of him. CRAP. That\'s bull, I was taking very, very good care of him. Then, my cow was about to die....for the 5th time. This must be suckfest. Well, anyway, I never got my horse back, my cow didn\'t die, and I got sick of buying chicken feed all the time so I bought 10 grand\'s worth of it. So in the end, everything was okay, because I didn\'t like that horse anyway. The moral of the story is don\'t take a horse from a stupid, indian-giver old man.\r\n\r\nThen Chance was talking on the phone with Emily and wouldn\'t talked to me. He hit me where it hurt.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen I found out that MEWITHOUTYOU IS COMING! In two days! So thought, \"HOLA CRAP! HOLA CRAP! MEWITHOUTYOU IS COMING IN TWO DAYS! MEWITHOUTYOU IS COMING IN TWO DAYS!\" mewithoutYou is my favorite. Then I found out that it\'s NEXT month. That is a disapointment because I don\'t know if I will be able to go. But it\'s also good, because I don\'t know if I would be able to go this Sunday since that\'s when my parents get back from the wedding in South Carolina. I don\'t think I will be able to go next month because it\'s a school night and because that is rigth before my parents take me to the last Bleach concert in Nashville. I don\'t know if they will take me, but it\'s looking good. I hope so. Anyway, my parents are awesome, so maybe I will get to go to both. They\'ve let all of my friends and I go to the Cotton Club on a school night before. Maybe I could get a ride.\r\n\r\n\r\nblblblblb\r\n\r\nI miss home.

He acted like he didn\'t know what he was talking about, he had just observed his surroundings and made stuff up. I think he was up to no good, but he seemed like a nice guy, it\'s just you never know. He had just gotten there, and was looking around the house.

This is hard, because I like you alot, but I want to be completely honest. I wasn\'t very honest this evening.\r\n\r\nAs you know, this boyfriend thing is completely new for me. I\'ve had a whole lot more experience in the friendship field. Based on my friendship experiences, I\'ve learned that listening is key to a healthy relationship. Through listening it\'s easy to see what someone really desires.\r\n\r\nI\'ve listened to you, Russell. I can see that you want a serious relationship, (much like Chance\'s and Emily\'s). You want to hold someone\'s hand and let them know that everything is okay. You want to spend quality time with someone all day, every day. You desire intamacy with someone special. I respect that.\r\n\r\nI\'m not at all accusing you of not listening to me. To be honest I haven\'t talked enough for you to be able to listen. It was definately my mistake. Tonight I saw that mistake. I\'m sorry. I thought I\'d tell you some things that you should\'ve known long before. First, it is waaaaaaaaaaaaay past my personal boundries to be alone with any guy, any where. But for some stupid reason, I didn\'t tell you that and I chose to ignore my limit. Second, I don\'t want a serious relationship right now. Don\'t get me wrong, I don\'t want to be dating 371623512635 guys at once, but I also don\'t want to be exclusive and intament to one guy. When I say that, I mean that I don\'t want to kiss, and spend my every breath talking to or about a guy. It just doesn\'t work for me. I don\'t want what Chance and Emily have. Personally, I think they\'re missing out on the best in life. I\'d rather just enjoy spending time with someone special. Those are my relationship desires. I\'m sorry that I didn\'t lay them out earlier.\r\n\r\nI really really really like you Russell. I don\'t want to end the relationship unless you think there is a dire need for it to be over. (hopefully not) But I needed to tell you that. And about the kiss, it wasn\'t all bad. (wink) But never again. ha. I want to be what you want, I hope I am, but if I can\'t make you happy then I don\'t even want to be there. I really do like you a whoooole lot.

It wasn\'t fun. There\'s just something about that school that is so depressing. I still can\'t tell if I like waking up early or not. I\'ve always heard of people gettin lost on the first day and everything, but it was kinda like the whole older people picking on the younger ones- it doesn\'t really happen. This time is actually is hard to find my way around. I never got lost, but it was a challenge. I just follow the person that is in all of my classes. If I didn\'t have someone like that, I might have gotten lost, but by now it\'s not bad. The only reason it\'s hard is because all of the people. You seriously can\'t see ahead, you just have to know which way to go from the start. Oh well, I  never got lost so it doesn\'t matter. I could go anywhere if nobody was in the halls HOLA CRAP THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE. I think the middle school is just 5 times bigger and that\'s why the halls are always empty. Like there would be places like doors and stuff where the people would get crowded, but it\'s like that everywhere. It\'s depressing but so is my own house, so I guess it not too bad. I\'m just so tired. I get to eat with Mary it\'s really cool. I get the feeling tha she doesn\'t want to eat with me as much as I want to eat with her but oh well. I can still eat with her. I haven\'t been able to eat. I don\'t know why. I\'m hungry when I wake up, but not when lunch comes. I just feel sick if I try. I never get to see my friends. They all left me at Hebron. and other schools. Some never went to my school in the first place. Yeah but going to school isn\'t the only work. They give us all this work to do after school. suck. It\'s already like the middle of the year. How lame. It\'s seems like so long since summer. oh soooo long. \r\n\r\nwow...two days.\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah so point is, I don\'t like high school. It\'s no fun like middle school was. It\'s okay, I know it will get better. Today I went to my locker for the first time and I couldn\'t get it open because of the stupid latch thing. I was doing the combination right and this cool girl helped me and I said \"OH! I have to pull up, not out!\" Then I barely made it back to class in time for the bus call bell- we had time left over so I asked the teacher if I could go to my locker. It rung thirty seconds before I got there. Poop. I didn\'t want to go in between classes. I wouldn\'t have time. I am slow. Curses. Then at when I was going to the bus I saw Tiffany that cool girl from Fort Walton that came up to me and said \"Hey you like Emery!\" or something like that and talked to me. I was just passing by I didn\'t get the chance to wave. We were both wearing our Emery shirts. Hooray for that!!\r\n\r\nhola crap there are a lot of buses. And every single person gets their own seat it\'s CRAZY. I like the bus. Not in the morning though. It\'s way boring then. Mary won\'t answer.

I went ot my great aunt\'s house. Definitely not my choice of fun on a Friday night, but definitely her choice of fun on a Friday night. On the way I asked my dad if we could stop by Best Buy. We couldn\'t find a Best Buy, but Wal-Mart was good enough. I wanted to get mewithoutYou or Norma Jean or The Swift. As I was looking for them, I didn\'t find any of them but I found Everyday Sunday which was a cd Jacob showed me and I had never thought of actually buying. I realized how much I liked them so I decided to buy it. Later on that night, everybody was doing their own thing, most of them watching the olympics on th eold antenna TV. I took out my new cd and started listening to it and reading the book. I just sat there for about 45 minutes or so listenign and reading all of it. It helped me so much. I have been the most discouraged ever for the last week. I can\'t even bare it. There\'s no hope. Everytiem I am at home, Satan sneaks in and starts bombarding me. I don\'t even feel like I have anyone to help me with it all. Sure, they are there...but not here. So as I sat there I realized that there was hope. Right now, I don\'t feel like there\'s hope, but...I don\'t know. Everyday Sunday is marvelous, if you ever see this cd, buy it! I promise.\r\n\r\nOn the way down to Thomson, I was listening to a quiet song on my headphones. For most of the song, especially the quiet parts, I would hear the car cd player bleed through. With things like this, I couldn\'t concentrate on either song. Sometimes, I would be able to begin to concentrate on one song, but then the other would butt in. Sometimes, I would get into the song on my headphones and then I would hear the car music and vice versa. It reminded me of how I\'m feel. All of these monster emotions attacking me. I can be feeling fine and then this huge pang of depression or frustration will attack me. I don\'t understand it. It\'s so hard.\r\nI feel so betrayed.\r\n\r\nHere is one of the songs that helped me so much:\r\nhe walked out the door that he came in \r\nand i said no don\'t go i will miss you my friend\r\nbut he didn\'t turn around he didn\'t turn around turn around \r\nhe didn\'t turn around when i fell on the ground\r\ni said where are you going\r\nyou used to like it here\r\ni said where are you going\r\nwhat is your fear\r\nbut he didn\'t turn around he didn\'t turn around turn around \r\nhe didn\'t turn around when i feel on the ground\r\nplease don\'t leave\r\nplease stay\r\nplease don\'t go away\r\ni just want to see you a whole new way\r\nHoly God your touch i just can\'t get enough\r\ni don\'t want to forget your eternal love\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI will stand up now\r\nI will not step down\r\nI will do my best to wear this crown\r\nBut I need You as You guide me through today\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI will never forget the time that we were in Jacob\'s truck and we were listening to Just a Story. His dad was whistling along. We probably had Joe Froni and Chuck&nbsp; in the back, too. There wasn\'t anythign special about it, I\'ll just never forget it.

So peaceful. I went to Sugarloaf tonight. I finally had someone to take me. My parents won\'t. They must not love me or something. Anyway, my sister is home for the last time, so she got to take me. It was nice to see some of my old friends. They all acted like I had never left. Well, I didn\'t leave, my parents just won\'t take me anymore. It was a peaceful night. It was interesting because they were talking about stress and tonight I feel completely at peace. I am sitting here writing a journal entry completely neglecting my homework and the 70 hundred words I have to know for the test tomorrow that are all huge words like socieconitechnilogicalism. It\'s okay though because it\'s important to relax. It\'s only 70 words, not 70 hundred. Actually I have two piles of notecards and the one that I can find, I know all of the words in it. I\'m going to do fine. And I actually did do my LA homework and my health homework is like 4 questions that I can do it 5 minutes so I\'m in good shape. Everyone should just calm down about everything and stop worrying so much. I know I can name some people that could use that. ha. On the way home, my sister and I talked and listened to mewithoutYou. We stopped at QuikTrip and got <i>massive</i> slushies which was awesome. Best part is, I don\'t feel sick after eating that whole thing. And these warm keys are warming my cool hands. Tomorrow is Friday. It\'s all down hill from here. Tomorrow I will get home from school and relax and the next morning, my sister, brother, and I will leave for Nashville. We will hang around the city for a bit, then at night we\'re going to a show at a place called Blue Sky Court. that\'s Saturday, August 28th. It will be Copeland, Matthew, and a band called Death Comes to Matteson. I don\'t know what Matthew sounds like because obviously, with the name Matthew, I can\'t search for them, but I heard Death Comes to Matteson on radiotakover and they sounded weird. So that will be awesome, then the next night we will head over to Rockettown to see Bleach! If you don\'t like Bleach and would like to hear them, I\'m sorry, but Sunday night is their last show ever. They are amazing. Also, there will be an awesome band called Seven Day Jesus that has broken up, but are playing a reunion show with their best friends, Bleach. Also, Relient K, The O.C. Supertones, and Holland will ALL be at this show. It will be an amazing weekend. The last time I get with my sister. She is moving to Colorado. She is such an amazing part of my life, I know she will do great out there. I can\'t wait. So, tomorrow will be a great day, and it\'s all downhill from there. Enjoy your week, I will miss you all.

I already vented it all out in my head. She was talking about me being selfish and all, just like she always does. I must be a bad son. Oh well, not my fault. We didn\'t have Bible Study.\r\n\r\nI went to Windy Gap this weekend. Sugarloaf went up for the weekend to do work crew. It was fun. Tiring. We headed to the church right when I got home form school. We headed over to the church after having sleeping bag issues and started to Windy Gap in the white van. We got there around I don\'t know but it was dark. It was so cool. Like a tree top city with many lights. And a willow tree. It\'s basically just like Sharptop, but with a much smaller lake and much more hilly. That place is so pretty. I just loved the hills. Oh well enough of that. We went in the food place and got assigned (or volunteered) jobs. I was a server. Being a server was awesome. (Except for once, but that\'s a long story.) I got to talk to lots of people. Setting up and cleaning up sucked though. And vaqcuuming, ew I hated that. Ha, don\'t worry, I paid to work. We had a lot of fun. Taking out the trash was the most fun. And pouring the raging river of tea and put them on the tables. I got to play with the cart. It was Xtreme. Now I have lots of respect for people that work everyday. Especially waiters and waitresses. It was exhausting. We got a <i>lot</i> of freetime though. We also worked a <i>lot</i>. After we got assigned things, we set up for breakfast the next morning. I saw a girl working with us, but she wasn\'t from Sugarloaf. I saw her talkign to Jacob and when I walked over, Jacob told me she knew all of my friends and all of his friends. It was crazy. She knew Mary. And she said she knew Garrick. That\'s crazy. Her name was Megan. Jacob and I hung out with her some which was cool. Even though we worked a ton, it was so much fun. I didn\'t ride the zipline. What a shame. Jacob had an ear infection(which means he couldn\'t get in the water) and I was with him the whole time so I just never did it. Tait came. It was awesome to see him. The first night we played volleyball/soccer to the xtreme with a bunch of little kids the first night. We played Mafia in our cabin after that. It was fun the first time, but after that it was dumb. The next night I fell in the lake fully clothed which totally sucked. I had my camera and my brand new mp3 player in my pocket. I had my Five Iron Frenzy hoodie on, too. Both stopped working. They\'re okay now. I hope my jacket doesn;t shrink. The next night, when everyone was playing silent football(they played it a dumb way), Jacob and I went to the talent show that all of the campers were having (they were having fmaily camp). It was hilarious. We never got to see they little rock star kids, though. That was lame. Those pimps could DANCE! We sat with Tait which was AWESOME! That guy is so cool. We stayed up really late talking on the island by the lake after that. Those kids getting blobbed went so high. A lot of people said thanks to me for working. There were a lot that made me feel better about the coffee inicdent, too. One night, we were having dinner and everyone wanted coffee. I went to go get two cups and came back out and gave them to the people that asked for them. Then, some dumb guy was asking me for soy sauce. Then, I realized that I had served some table and totally neglected them after that. The parents were talking to each other and basically ignoring me when I tried to ask them if I needed anything else, so I just had to rely on the little children to tell me if they wanted anything else. There were a bunch of little kids asking for coffee, too. So by now I was freaking out. Then eveyone else started serving desert and my people were still asking for coffee and food. Everyone brings out desert at the same time and I was still serving food. Then, people started asking for decaf and regular coffee. I finally got a bunch of coffee because you have to wait in line 2 or 3 minutes to get the coffee (there was a massive coffee shortage). I walked out then CRAP! I forgot which coffee was which. I was just like whatever and gave it to them anyway and asked the other tables if they wanted anything. I was serving 4 tables of 8 people. Many still wanted coffee. I went to go get some coffee. When I came back out, they said they didn\'t ask for any. I took it back. When I came back out to ask them if they needed anything they said they still hadn\'t gotten their coffee. I went to get some coffee. I brought it back out and yet again, they said they didn\'t ask for it. By now I was about to scream. I went back to get all the desert (that\'s 4 trips, but somehow, many had already gotten desert) and when I had finally finished I sat down. I was mad so I told everyone in the kitchen that coffee was stupid and should be different colors so that I wouldn\'t get them mixed up. That made me feel better. I was stressed out so I sat down outside the kitchen (in the room where eveyone was eating) and listened to Tait talk. Eventually, this lady that was all pissed off walked up to me and said, \"My husband and I still haven\'t gotten our coffee!\" I thought, \"You know what, screw you.\" I just went in the kitchen and stayed there. I might have tried to bring it out to them, but everyone was dismissed when I came out. Also, the next morning, Kelsey was being I want to cuss you out stupid. I can\'t stand that girl. Whatever happened to love your enemies. holy crap that\'s hard. Then we headed home and it took forever to get home. It was okay though. My mom was being I want to cuss you out stupid, too. We didn\'t have Bible Study.\r\n\r\nAs for today, it was pointless. I waited for the bus for 20 minutes and it never came, so we drove to school and then it came. I was listening to the radio and the guy said some school systems were canceled. I listened closely. Not ours. So, we went to school and it took forever because of flooding and traffic and such. The whole day, we didn\'t have any power except for a few lights here and there. No air conditioning.  In Latin, we just played Mafia because I had just learned how to play and told everyone. It was really stupid. No one could play it good. or well. whichever. Math was hot. On the way home, I was wondering if I had learned a single thing that day or not. All I could think of was that if there is a hurricane, they won\'t count you late if you get there at 7:30.\r\n\r\n\r\nEveryone thought I was acting weird yesterday. Sorry, I didn\'t know.\r\n\r\nI was thinking on the trip home from Winday Gap and I decided that two thing I can\'t stand more that anything in the entire world are cell phones and people chewing gum, ESPECIALLY when they take it out and stick in paper.

I don\'t understand how they can run that far. If only 2 people had raced, he would have gotten 1 1/2. There were like 60 billion people racing and they ran about 30 billion miles. We got there about 2 seconds after they took off. We wouldn\'t have seen him pass if we were about 10 seconds earlier, but I go to yell for him so it was okay. After that, we went to Altar then to Moe\'s and it was awesome. Wednesday, I went to church with Stephen. That was cool. Other than that, I can\'t remember anything else I was goign to say.

I showed them something on the site they wrote about Cornerstone and this is how she replied:\r\n\r\n<font color=\"#FF6633\">\"Hey Ruh and thanks for the email.  We can talk more about this.  The first real issue is just doing \"extra things\" that cost money.  Right now you have already commited to going on the trip.  So until you get all that money and some extra it\'s not even something we could consider.  \r\n \r\nI\'m glad you love music.  You rock babe.  So let\'s talk more about this group.  Daddy and I have to limit work and play in our lives too.  It\'s hard.  We\'d much rather play all the time but we\'d might get a little too hungry if we did ya know.  \r\n \r\nI\'m just kidding about the demon possessed music.  I just think it\'s crazy but I do believe God is using groups like this to reach some kids that wouldn\'t listen to anything else.\r\n \r\nLove ya man!\r\nMama\"\r\n</font>\r\n\r\nSo that\'s definitely good. I mowed the grass today. Our mower is being really gay, so I couldn\'t mow the field, but I mowed the inside yard with the push mower. I didn\'t think I was actually going to do the whole thing, but I did and I finally have it done! Heck yes!  I\'ve been put in a beautiful mood today. When I was mowing, everything was so pretty. Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt. the clouds covered the whole sky. Eventually, as I mowed and it got later, the clouds parted and I had clear blue sky on my right and smooth, white clouds on my left. Then the sun burst out in my face, when I was beginning to finish. I definitely like the clouds better, but the sun was probably getting lonely. I can feel the cool autumn coming. I love it. I love fall. I saw leaves fall for the first time yesterday. I can\'t wait until all of the leaves start falling.\r\n\r\n\r\n<font color=\"yellow\">Don\'t waste your lips on words I\'ve heard before \r\nKiss my tired head. \r\nAnd each letter written wastes your hand, young man \r\nCome and lead me to your bed \r\nYou gave me hope that I\'d not lost her \r\nAnd then thought it rather strange to see me smile- \r\nas I don\'t do too much smiling these days. </font>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\'ll never be able to finish To Kill a Mockingbird in time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is long, but very, very pretty:\r\n\r\n<font color=\"blue\">I am the only one to blame for this\r\nSomehow it all adds up the same\r\nSoaring on the wings of selfish pride\r\nI flew too high and like Icarus I collide\r\nWith a world I try so hard to leave behind\r\nTo rid myself of all but love\r\nto give and die\r\n\r\nTo turn away and not become\r\nAnother nail to pierce the skin of one who loves\r\nmore deeply than the oceans,\r\nmore abundant than the tear\r\nOf a world embracing every heartache\r\n\r\n\r\nCan I be the one to sacrifice\r\nOr grip the spear and watch the blood and water flow\r\n\r\n<font color=\"#3399FF\">\r\nTo love you - take my world apart\r\nTo need you - I am on my knees\r\nTo love you - take my world apart\r\nTo need you - broken on my knees\r\n</font>\r\n\r\nAll said and done I stand alone\r\nAmongst remains of a life I should not own\r\nIt takes all I am to believe\r\nIn the mercy that covers me\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you really have to die for me?\r\nAll I am for all you are\r\nBecause what I need and what I believe are worlds apart\r\n\r\nAnd I pray\r\n\r\nI look beyond the empty cross\r\nforgetting what my life has cost\r\nand wipe away the crimson stains\r\nand dull the nails that still remains\r\nMore and more I need you now,\r\nI owe you more each passing hour\r\nbattle between grace and pride\r\ngive up not so long ago\r\nSo steal my heart and take the pain,\r\nwash the feet and cleanse my pride\r\ntake the selfish, take the weak,\r\nand all the things I cannot hide\r\ntake the beauty, take my tears\r\nthis sin-soaked heart and make it yours\r\ntake my world apart\r\ntake it now, take it now\r\nand serve the ones that I despise\r\nspeak the words I can\'t deny\r\nwatch the world I used to love\r\nfall to dust get blown away\r\nI look beyond the empty cross\r\nforgetting what my life has cost\r\nso wipe away the crimson stains\r\nand dull the nails that still remain\r\nso steal my heart and take the pain\r\ntake the selfish, take the weak\r\nand all the things I cannot hide\r\ntake the beauty, take my tears\r\ntake my world apart, take my world apart\r\nand I pray, and I pray, and I pray\r\ntake my world apart\r\n\r\nWorlds apart.</font>','','','publish','open','open','','312','','','2004-09-14 17:55:00','2004-09-14 17:55:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=312',0,'post','',2),(313,2,'2004-09-16 16:42:00','2004-09-16 16:42:00','Well, I finnally got my livejournal to look better, so yeah\r\n\r\nI just have one more thing to say:\r\nHAHAHAHAHA!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B0002Y4T56.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg\">\r\nNEW MEWITHOUTYOU SONG ON PUREVOLUME!','','','publish','open','open','','313','','','2004-09-16 16:42:00','2004-09-16 16:42:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=313',0,'post','',2),(314,2,'2004-09-16 22:03:00','2004-09-16 22:03:00','My little bro got a livejournal!

Do not get me wrong, I am extremely thankful that they allow me to go to concerts at all, but they should not let me go to certain concerts and not others (within reason). When I tell them about a concert that is more hardcore than others, they hesitate. Also, they have let me go to concerts on school nights before, but other times, will not let me. Normally, they drop me off, (granted that I have my friends or someone else to keep me safe) and go do other things around the city until it is time to go home. The time is up to their discretion. \r\n	One specific show that I want to go to is a band called Norma Jean. This is the kind of band that my parents say is loud and that you cannot understand. All of the music I listen to is positive and appropriate. Norma Jean is a band that reaches out to people that may shut their ears to what a church, friend, or leader might have to say to them. There are even things they say in their music and on and off stage the show that they are Christian and have good morals. When a girl at Cornerstone—a festival they played at—got hurt, they said on their website, “…and there was no physical damage or anything like that, which I guess means it was a spiritual happening. Something on a far deeper and more serious level than the physical level than the physical. This is about all that we know about it. We did not talk to the girl, but after the show, we, and some of our friends, spent a lot of time in prayer, which was a really good thing. Just praying for her and many other things in our lives. So, whatever it was, it led to much unity between us and our friends….and the body of Christ in general.” \r\nIn their music, they have things to say like, “Christ is not a fashion, fleeting away,” and “Stop searching and find Me, I am stabbed by grace and slinging blood,” referring to Jesus, and “God has stolen my heart, so I will write it down.” Though some of the lyrics are violent, it is because the world is such a violent place. It is not for just the reason of mindless violence that many movies, books, music, magazines, etc. of today present. They should be much more concerned with the movies I see or the things I see or read on the internet than my idea of what is an appropriate concert. They also don’t like how Norma Jean and many other bands scream, but there are many different kinds of music. Other types of music like opera, you cannot understand, but that does not mean that it is “demon possessed”. They tell me that they don’t listen to opera and that my music is “demon possessed”. When I talk to them about it not being demon possessed, they tell me that they are just kidding, but none of these bands even come close to this. They serve a complete opposite purpose. Screaming can be just as normal as whispering or singing softly, just on the opposite side or that scale. For example, Underoath screams, “Jesus, I’m ready to come home,” and New Day Awakening screams, “Holy, holy, holy, is the lamb. I bow my face before the King. This King is everything. You are my God. You are everything. And I worship you. I worship you Spirit of Truth. And I just lay my face upon the floor…” It can be just as emotional as singing quietly.\r\n	Also, they won’t let me go on school nights. Now this can be good because it’s not a good habit to do things far away on school nights, but I should be able to on occasions. Many bands only come around so often, and the chance of them coming on a Friday night is very small. Now on a school night, homework and sleep are very important. It shouldn’t be lost for a concert; it could even make grades drop. Though this is true, there are ways to avoid the consequences. You could get extra sleep the night before, and make sure all your homework is done before you leave. You could even take a nap before the show.\r\n	So though some of this music sounds like it is a bad type of music to listen to, there is nothing wrong with it. They are all Christian bands that have very good causes. I should be able to go to a Norma Jean concert just as much as I can any other concert.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\'m not sure if it\'s good or not, but whether it\'s good or bad, I hope you like it. Now that I have this out of the way, I don\'t have much to worry about.','breathing out suicide','','publish','open','open','','breathing-out-suicide','','','2004-09-23 18:35:00','2004-09-23 18:35:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=320',0,'post','',8),(321,2,'2004-09-25 21:55:00','2004-09-25 21:55:00','I\'ve decided that curious is definitely my favorite icon.','They don\'t want the God.

They are all Christian bands that have very good causes. I should be able to go to a Norma Jean concert just as much as I can any other concert. Norma Jean has good lyrics, says positive things on and off stage, and I should be able to go to concerts on school nights, on occasion.','they;re not goign to let me go','','publish','open','open','','theyre-not-goign-to-let-me-go','','','2004-09-26 22:50:00','2004-09-26 22:50:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=323',0,'post','',2),(324,2,'2004-09-27 18:48:00','2004-09-27 18:48:00','<font size=\"23\">66 6\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAISE THE\r\n\r\nWAR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMACHINE></font>\r\n\r\nburn tonight\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJesus, i love you, i\'m telling you write here in the middle of the WORLD WIDE WEB because i am unashamed of my love for you, and i want you to know that!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSorry, Chance, I just had to steal it.','','','publish','open','open','','324','','','2004-09-27 18:48:00','2004-09-27 18:48:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=324',0,'post','',2),(325,2,'2004-09-27 19:00:00','2004-09-27 19:00:00','hahahahhah this is the most hilarious thing I\'ve seen in awhile:\r\n\r\nhttp://yll.loxa.edu.tw/avi/a/02090120203701.wmv\r\n\r\n\r\nIt reminds me EXACTLY of my friends and I.','','','publish','open','open','','325','','','2004-09-27 19:00:00','2004-09-27 19:00:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=325',0,'post','',2),(326,2,'2004-09-28 14:36:00','2004-09-28 14:36:00','I feel like singing Psalms meaning songs singing praises all day long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite our selfish thoughts,\r\nDespite our lack of hope,\r\nDespite our lack of faith,\r\nDespite our stony hearts.\r\nDespite the waning moon,\r\nDespite the ebbing tide of how we think this world should be,\r\nPraise God, from whom all blessings flow,\r\nPraise him all creatures here below,\r\nPraise him above ye heavenly host,\r\nPraise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\n<b>\r\n\r\n<font size=\"5\">Which is better Five Iron Frenzy or Taking Back Sunday?</font>\r\n\r\nAnd remember kids:</b>\r\nYoung children are notorious for asking questions that make parents squirm, especially when it comes to sexuality.

A writ of habeas corpus is a judicial mandate to a prison official ordering that an inmate be brought to the court so it can be determined whether or not that person is imprisoned lawfully and whether or not he should be released from custody. A habeas corpus petition is a petition filed with a court by a person who objects to his own or another\'s detention or imprisonment. The petition must show that the court ordering the detention or imprisonment made a legal or factual error. Habeas corpus petitions are usually filed by persons serving prison sentences. In family law, a parent who has been denied custody of his child by a trial court may file a habeas corpus petition. Also, a party may file a habeas corpus petition if a judge declares her in contempt of court and jails or threatens to jail her.\r\n\r\nNow you know.','habeas corpus','','publish','open','open','','habeas-corpus','','','2004-09-29 15:43:00','2004-09-29 15:43:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=329',0,'post','',0),(330,2,'2004-09-30 14:33:00','2004-09-30 14:33:00','Dear Mr. Strauss,\r\n\r\nHaiti and the Dominican Republic are desperately trying to recover from the devastating effects of Hurricane Jeanne. The storm swept through the island of Hispaniola where the two countries are located and released torrential rains that triggered floods. In Haiti, floods and mudslides killed over 1,500 people and left more than 1,200 missing. The storm killed 25 people in the Dominican Republic.\r\n\r\nThe Assessment Continues\r\n\r\nAlthough Compassion’s assessment of the devastation inflicted by Jeanne is ongoing, we have not received any reports of fatalities among Compassion-assisted children in either country. But eight projects in Gonaives, a northwestern Haitian city, and many projects in the Dominican Republic have sustained severe damage. Many are still completely flooded and inaccessible. If your Compassion child or project is affected, we will contact you directly. \r\n\r\nCommunication with the project staff is difficult but you can read about the storm’s aftermath  and Compassion’s response to it. For the most current information about the storm’s effect on our projects in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, please visit our Crisis Update web page. \r\n\r\nPrayer Needed for Those Affected\r\n\r\nPlease pray for those who are affected by this overwhelming storm and for the safety of Compassion children, staff and projects in Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPraise the war machine.','Wislere','','publish','open','open','','wislere','','','2004-09-30 14:33:00','2004-09-30 14:33:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=330',0,'post','',0),(331,2,'2004-09-30 17:36:00','2004-09-30 17:36:00','Well, I\'ve gotten all of my money.

It\'s not all about going on big trips and listening to big speakers and being bored and not paying attention in big sermons. It\'s all about getting close together, just like a group of people does on a cold winter day to keep each other warm. It\'s not about big singers and big stages. It\'s about just not worrying about other stuff and just worshipping together. It sounds beautiful.

Instead, a far more useful one would substitute \'faith\' for \'belief\' where faith is defined as the \"firm belief in something for which there is no proof.\" A universal definition of nihilism could then well be the rejection of that which requires faith for salvation or actualization and would span to include anything from theology to secular ideology. Within nihilism faith and similar values are discarded because they\'ve no absolute, objective substance, they are invalid serving only as yet another exploitable lie never producing any strategically beneficial outcome. Faith is an imperative hazard to group and individual because it compels suspension of reason, critical analysis and common sense. Nietzsche once said that faith means not wanting to know. Faith is \"don\'t let those pesky facts get in the way of our political plan or our mystically ordained path to heaven\"; faith is \"do what I tell you because I said so\". All things that can\'t be disproved need faith, utopia needs faith, idealism needs faith, spiritual salvation needs faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI went to a football game last night. It was my frist one except for NG homecoming last year. Actually, I remember going to a Brookwood game <i>years</i> ago. Chris, Heather, Chuck, Drew, Haley, and I went. Afterwards, we went to the place in downtown Dacula and the Melins played. It was awesome. I didn\'t love their music, but they were <i>extremely</i> talented. It was like ska without trumpets/rap/hardcore. The band wasn\'t really that hardcore, the setting just made them seem hardcore. They were awesome though. Yeah it was pretty awesome. Then Drew and Chuck came over. Yesterday after school, I went to Hebron to pick up Chuck and everyone was like AHH RUSSELL and it was so cool because I knew everyone. I wish I could go to that school so bad. I know it\'s not all fun and games like it seems though. I just seriously think if God wants me to go there then i will, so I don\'t have to worry about. I don\'t think he does but eh, who knows. At Bible Study every week, they always ask what God has been sayign to you and I never really know what to tell them but right now I know that I seriously need to watch what I say. At Altaer we talked about how the tongue can destroy anything or fix everything, at the Melin show they talked about the same thing in James, I\'ve noticed how extremely rude and mean everybody is to each other, I\'ve noticed how mean I am to other people, I remember when Dustin got mad at us at Bible Study for putting everyone down, and I\'ve just noticed how much it hurts. They may not even realize it. \r\n\r\nLast night was the coldest night of my life. I got to talk to Chris Cooley and he drew the most amazing picture in my journal. Garrick and Gee off stood us up for the Mill Creek game.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I am getting a Norma Jean hoodie. it\'s gonna be friggen sweet. Roepr cd comes out Tuesday.

I like reading it. A lot. You will do amzing thing Jacob. Everyoen tell Jacob he will do amazing things because he will. Anyone else that is going to help me make my hardcore church, save up a dollar and maybe we\'ll have ten dollars. That didn\'t make any sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis entry also goes out to Mrs. Cooper for reading this and having the coolest kid I\'ve ever met.

I had a little italian food and then proceeded to great clips by amc to get the good asian lady as opposed to the one at great clips that gives everyone bowl cuts. When we got onto my road, my mom said i could drive down the road and into our driveway, so we got out and switched sides. So as I\'m driving down my dirt road, I\'m driving like 2 miles an hour. So just my luck, I look in the rear view mirror and this ginormous school bus with about forty bajillion middle schoolers is right behind me, and I\'m going slower than mollasess...\r\n\r\nsuck. To make things worse, my driveway is like impossible to get into, so I practically stop and we\'re just sitting there until I almost destroy the mailbox. My mom gets out and walks around and gets in the drivers seat and backs up and everything while the stupid bus is still sitting there. It sucked. So then my brother got off the bus, they left, and I tried it again.\r\n\r\nbut hey, at least I\'m allowed to drive now.\r\n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v118/BuddyofSponge/Permit.jpg\">\r\n\r\nTonight I\'m going to see Oceans 12 with my youth group even though I haven\'t seen the first one and then go to Eric\'s house to play Halo with everyone like usual.

We\'re trying to train him and teach him and keep him from destroying our stuff. Luckily, he hasn\'t peed on that many things, but the thing he has had trouble with is being alone. Whenever we put him in his cage, he barks and wimpers and makes lots of noise. It\'s annoying and becomes a problem at night. When we went to church yesterday, he somehow escaped his high security cage, and was wandering around the house when we got home. Late last night, he was barking and making so much noise, it was out of hand. Everyone else was asleep. I was way upstairs in my room, and could still hear him. So, I had to go downstairs and put him in a tiny little kennel with only enough room for him and put in a bathroom closet in the back of the house and turn the bathroom fan on so no one could hear him. It made me feel terrible, but he has to learn. There are going to be times where he has to be alone, and it\'s for his own good. This reminded me exactly of us. We complain and bark and yelp when times are hard, but really, it\'s for our own good. We say, \"God, I hate you! Why are you doing this to me???\" and we make it unpleasant for everyone around us. It makes me realize how hard it is to be a parent. God doesn\'t like to see us in pain. Our parents don\'t enjoy seeing us unhappy, but that\'s the only way to learn.','roper','','publish','open','open','','roper','','','2005-01-03 12:46:00','2005-01-03 12:46:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=389',0,'post','',4),(390,2,'2005-01-05 17:45:00','2005-01-05 17:45:00','<img src=\"http://www.joebly.com/7-Fisheye-Lawn.jpg\">','trees','','publish','open','open','','trees','','','2005-01-05 17:45:00','2005-01-05 17:45:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=390',0,'post','',0),(391,2,'2005-01-05 19:29:00','2005-01-05 19:29:00','Playa of the day:\r\n<img src=\"http://img10.imgspot.com/u/05/4/12/Playa.jpg\">','I never post more than once a day, but this calls for it.','','publish','open','open','','i-never-post-more-than-once-a-day-but-this-calls-for-it','','','2005-01-05 19:29:00','2005-01-05 19:29:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=391',0,'post','',6),(392,2,'2005-01-06 17:00:00','2005-01-06 17:00:00','ALERT!\r\n\r\n\r\ninsufficient data coming through!\r\n\r\n\r\nALERT!','one girl army','','publish','open','open','','one-girl-army','','','2005-01-06 17:00:00','2005-01-06 17:00:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=392',0,'post','',0),(393,2,'2005-01-07 19:24:00','2005-01-07 19:24:00','Someday my room will be like this:\r\n<img src=\"http://img13.imgspot.com/u/05/6/12/speakers.jpg\">\r\n\r\n\r\nYa sabur, subhannallahi, a\'udhu billahi minash-shaitanir-rajim, al-hamdu lilllah, bismillahir rahmanir rahim\r\n\r\n<font size=\"4\">يا صبور, سبحانالله, اعوذ بالله من الشيطن الرجيم, الحمدلله, باسم الله الرحمن الرحيم\r\n</font>\r\n\"Oh patient [one], glory to God, I take refuge in God from the accursed Devil, praise to God, in the name of God the Compassionate the Gracious. \"','speakers','','publish','open','open','','speakers','','','2005-01-07 19:24:00','2005-01-07 19:24:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=393',0,'post','',2),(394,2,'2005-01-08 14:58:00','2005-01-08 14:58:00','I don\'t know what it is, but this is how I feel today.\r\n<img src=\"http://img10.imgspot.com/u/05/7/07/Untitled2.jpg\">\r\nI don\'t feel like sleeping.

It will be cool. We\'re supposed to raise money and I haven\'t raised a penny, but I just called and talked to my grandma and she said she will give me some money and I will ask my teachers tomorrow so I\'m very relieved. I was terrified that I would show up Friday without any money and look like a jerk. I would never go door to door. That\'s so tacky. Well, I don\'t know about never, but I wouldn\'t do it unless I was desperate. or in the mood. But actually, thinking about all of this fasting stuff makes me want to fast more than 30 hours. I\'ve wanted to do it for more, but have never done it just because what the kids at school would say. I plan on doing it tomorrow for at least 24 hours. The thing is, by lunch tomorrow I will already have been fasting for 23 hours without even realizing it, so I think I will do it for at least 48 hours. I just hope this year we don\'t have the super ugly, bright t shirts. We also had the first missions meeting. I went in there a little less than dreading the boringness of it, but came out satisfied because it was a lot more fun than I thought it would be, not boring. I also left feeling a little stupid because of some of the things people said to me and for everyone laughing at some of the things I said. It\'s insane how many people are going. Forty people! After the meeting, Chuck, Dalton, and I went to Discover Mills and saw Hitch. It wasn\'t bad. We\'re going to Mexico, by the way. It sounds like a blast. We\'ll be staying in tents, no showers, and buliding 2 houses for families who make tents out of any junk they can find. I pray that we\'ll represent Christ in the way he deserves, and that some of the less prepared kids will mature and learn new things.

It\'s hard to even know what to say. I never express myself through writing anymore. It\'s tough to find the perfect balance between private self-expression and public communication. Writing in a perfectly private booklet hidden in a private room may offer the freedom of unlimited expression, yet gives little satisfaction of purposeful writing. Conversely, too, the satisfaction of public thought and expression cuts off the freedom of privacy that self-offered journalism gives. Often times it satisfies to continually type whatever may come to mind, but this type of stream of consciousness sounds inartistic or even silly on review or from a third person. This leads to another challenge: the decision between a story-telling, anecdotal entry or an aesthetic, artistically developing perspective. Or a mix of both? But then the elementary-feeling, anecdotal entries cause the aesthetic perspectives to seem out of place. \r\n\r\nIn other ways, it is so inexplicably difficult to describe so many mixed together emotions into a coherent and cohesive piece that it soon becomes more work than it is enjoyment. Or frustration. I have no idea where my life will take me from day to day at this point. My heart feels such a strong desire for love; my brain strives incredibly for knowledge; my body seeks after fitness and comfort; my life tries constantly to find purpose; my spirit seeks God in every way while trying to balance and battle with other priorities in my life; my conscience consistently persuades me to do what\'s right or expresses guilt over past experience; my logic attempts to guide me along with reason; and I am in the middle merged by every element, trying to discover where I should be, what I should do, what I should feel, why I should feel that way, and what might come next. But that brings me full circle. What comes next? When will I fall in love? When will I find spiritual satisfaction without guilt? When will I finally experience true comfort? If there are so many opportunities for love out there,  how do I manage to evade one-hundred percent of them? Because I know it certainly isn\'t my behavior. My logic tells me that it\'s the decisions and priorities in my life that I\'ve chosen that lead me to that. Why should that be, though? Why do I deserve a blow to my self-esteem for making wise decisions and living frugally? I so badly want to make the permanent, peaceful connection with my past that will make my uneasiness flee. I so badly want the peace I feel when I think of my childhood, think of the people I\'ve spent so many happy memories with, think of activities that have given myself euphony through association or mis-prioritization or some other elements that I can\'t put my finger on enough to put to words or explain or even know what I feel. Whatever it is, it was something right. It was something so very true and right that I haven\'t forgotten that feeling even in the slightest ever since. It\'s the same feeling as spiritual peace, spiritual enlightenment, yet is much more tangible and much more concrete. It\'s a search for identity; a search for meaning; a search for satisfaction. \r\n\r\nWhen will that come? What will it look like in my life, and what will it replace? Who will she be? How will she feel towards me? Why don\'t I see her? How close is she? Can I speed it up? Should I? Will I regret these feelings later and deem them as too close to wishing my days away? I dwell in my nostalgia, yet swim in my daily joy of life.\r\n\r\nCould you please find me and show me who I am?','Emotion.','','publish','open','open','','emotion','','','2008-09-25 02:17:00','2008-09-25 02:17:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=437',0,'post','',18),(438,2,'2008-10-21 02:32:00','2008-10-21 02:32:00','Me and Kevin are the flyest niggas that have ever walked on the face of this earth.

Thoughts crowded my head as I tried to organize my emotions, straighten out what I thought, put my finger on exactly what it was I even felt. I began to feel overwhelmed. I didn\'t know how to react to all of my feelings: what I should do, how I should act, what the correct way to handle my life at this point is, how I\'m SUPPOSED to feel, what I\'m SUPPOSED to do. And I knew there wasn\'t a right answer. I know there isn\'t a right answer. I want to tread so lightly that it hurts. I don\'t know how to do that. I don\'t know what it will even lead to. My thoughts are a mess. My thoughts are a mess. Unorganized. Scattered. Loose. Unorganized. Overwhelmed. Over-thought. Over-analyzed. Yet, carefully planned out. But still not enough to coherently understand myself. Why is it so difficult to work with people towards a common goal? Why are my thoughts so FRANTIC? I\'m leading myself to imminent doom! That\'s why! I\'m terrified! I\'m treading so carefully that I terrify my own feet, which then leads them to clumsiness! \r\n\r\nI\'ve conditioned myself for years. I\'ve meticulously built my character and painstakingly learned from the experience of my mistakes to create in myself a better person. I\'ve laid the foundation of who I am. I\'ve proven to myself what it means to be diligent. I\'ve carefully formed each detail regarding every aspect of my own character. Yet I still feel hopeless. I feel naked and out of control of myself. I don\'t know how to deal with you, and it\'s getting to me. Normally, my own will and control allows me to do what\'s right. Allows me to discern and carefully build a sturdy foundation. If you want something done correctly, do it yourself. That doesn\'t work this time. I want so badly the comfort of knowing the future. I\'ve never wanted to see into the future. Right now, I do. Please tell me we will get out of this what we put into it. \r\n\r\nWhy did God make me the way he did? I ask this every single day. I dwell on this. I scream at him. Did he not know what he was doing to us? God, you must give me wisdom. You must give me discernment. You must guide me with every step, every breath, every thought, every existence. I don\'t know what to do. I don\'t know how to grab my emotions by the neck and control them. I don\'t know how to control them at all. I\'m at such a beautiful moment. I\'m at such a crucial moment. \r\n\r\nI knew at this point, I needed to release everything crammed inside of my head. I grabbed my bike and left. It was so dark. I still cannot believe how dark it was. The moon was full, yellow, and huge. My eyes darted from every moving branch to every scattering rock on the ground. I was legitimately scared. Why would that happen to me? Why would I be scared out in the dark on a road I\'ve lived on for so many years? I\'ve gone out in the dark alone so many times and never had a care. But tonight I was scared. How does that happen? I knew I needed to breathe hard. I needed to work my legs. I needed the wind in my hair, and I needed to feel my speed. I cannot even tell you what blood flowing can do for a frantic mind. It\'s miraculous. \r\n\r\nGod, you must take me where I need to be. You cannot lead me here to take a wrong turn. You cannot show me the way to failure. You cannot build up my opportunity to have me beaten down and defeated. I promise you that I want what\'s right. But at this point, it literally seems impossible. Not because it is unachievable; because I cannot see it. Show it to me. Show it to us. Build us up. Let us look to you. Let us need you. Let us hold on steadfast to each other and be comforted in your peace. Let us be a beautiful light that shines to everyone within sight. \r\n\r\nI have no idea where you are taking me. I have absolutely no idea. I cannot say that enough. I am so incredibly clueless of where I am going that it overwhelms me to the point of distress. Let it be where you have put me. Nothing has happened without reason. Nothing has lead me here to be in the wrong place. You have me where you want me. Now use it. Use me. This MUST work. I cannot explain to you with any accuracy how I need this.\r\n\r\nYou are the blood flowing through my fingers: all through the soil and in the trees. You are the blood that I may see you. You are the blood in me. You are the earth on which I travel. You are the earth under my feet, that I may travel with you. You are the earth on which I write these circumstances.

The person in question will always have a justifiable reason for behaving the way that he behaves. No person feels any internal qualms with the way he deals with a situation or else he would not have taken that approach in the first place. That person will think, just as I think everyday, &quot;I don\'t see how I could have done any differently from what I have&quot; (President William Taft). <br /><br />So then why do I have such a hard time finding someone to care for me? Why is it so hard to find a match? It can\'t possibly be my fault. What have I done? What did I do to deserve the way people treat me sometimes? I treat others, especially those whom I care about, with love, with understanding, with compassion, with an open-mind and an open-heart, yet I literally cannot find anyone who can accentuate my characteristics, bring out the good in me, compliment my eccentricities, and make me a better person. That, of course, goes both ways. I want someone who can sharpen me and that I can sharpen. I want someone that we may play off each other more smoothly and amusingly than a jazz swing dancer works together with his partner.<br /><br />And equally frustrating, why is it so difficult to find a loving community that I feel a part of, that I feel loved in, that makes me comfortable, that I feel is a better place when I am around? Why are we so prone to conflict and putting others down? Do others not see the world the same way that I do? Obviously, I make mistakes. I screw things up. I don\'t deny that. But I am willing to work things out and understand others\' perspectives. So why cannot people do the same for me? <br /><br />Loneliness is the difference in my desire between where I want to be and where I am. I am lonely. I could be surrounded by all of my greatest friends and still be lonely. I feel that life is mocking me everyday. I am so very close to being exactly where I want to be, yet I am not. I am so happy and so thankful for everything I have and where I am in life, but I\'m still lonely. I am the only one that thinks I\'m going crazy, and I don\'t know what to do. I am a simple person. I do not need much to be satisfied. I am grateful, but not satisfied. There is an emptiness inside me that every person on this earth that I have met has proven to me they cannot fill. Everyday, I wonder if that emptiness will ever be filled or if it is a part of being human. Will I be on my deathbed decades from now still hurting from that unfulfillable emptiness that I feel today? It is not the God-hole inside me. God is very much alive in my life and working on me everyday. He offers me fulfillment. He offers me comfort. He offers me meaning in life. But he does not offer me comfort from this emptiness I feel. He does not give me the ability to stand against the waves of my own emotion. I\'m sure there is a reason, but offering a starving child the comfort that he will soon eat does not ease the pain in his stomach. I don\'t really know what to do with myself and with my life right now. I am strong, but I am struggling. I don\'t know how to accurately describe how I feel. It is as if I am undergoing a very painful operation, but God is easing my pain with his own anesthetic. I can still feel the pain. I still feel myself changing in ways that are very uncomfortable and very intense, but my pain is numbed by the comfort I so diligently asked for. Never have I prayed for something to happen outside of my own control and seen it happen. I believe that God does not grant prayers such as, &quot;God, heal this person\'s condition,&quot; or &quot;Lord, let something happen that will offer me the means of escape from this financial struggle I\'m in.&quot; Instead, he listens to those who desire change in themselves. This life is not about staying healthy or gaining wealth or helping others, even. This life is about building character. This life is about deciding how you will react to everything that life or God throws at you. Bad things will always happen to good people as long time continues to go on, but it is how those good people react to those bad things in their lives that show who they really are and show true meaning in life. A meticulously polished character is behind a truly much stronger person. Instead, God will listen to prayers such as, &quot;God, make me a wise man. Show me how to do this. Show things to me that others are blind to,&quot; or &quot;God, please give me the sanity to make it through this alive,&quot; or &quot;God, PLEASE make me into the person you want me to be and PLEASE show me what I\'m supposed to do in this life. Show me where I am supposed to be!&quot; or even, &quot;GOD! What the hell do you want me to do?? How am I supposed to know how to handle this situation?? All you\'ve provided me with is shit and you expect me to live through this?? Give me the strength and insight to do this because you very well know that I cannot!!&quot;<br /><br />So thus, God, I pray that you may make me into the person you want me to be. I pray that you will lead my life in the exact direction that you desire it, no matter the cost. Give me the strength to deal with the pain and suffering that result from you changing my heart. Make me a man after your own heart. Give me wisdom like you have given no other, and show me how to use it to change myself and to change others. Give me the understanding that I need to deal with other people and lead me to this loving community that I know you have designed for me somewhere out there. Let me change this world in ways that it will never be the same again. Be my guide and please never leave me. Lead me to the person that can fill my emptiness inside. Do whatever it takes. And whenever the pain comes that leads me to that person, please stay right there with me because you know very well that I will not be able to handle it alone. Grant me control over my own emotions, and make me a steadfast person. Give my mind the acuity to deal with whatever situation you may put me through. I love you and will never forget you or leave you as long as I live. I want you to know that, and pray that you will give me these things as my only intent is to become the person you want me to be and truly better myself. May you throw me forth into the world and be an example to all who see me, friends, family, strangers, everyone. Thank you for all you\'ve given me and for making me the person you have made me. <br /><br /><br /><em>I don\'t know what you want anymore. No, I don\'t know what you want anymore.

Does that make you feel better about yourself? I wonder: does is boost your already high self-esteem? Sometimes I really just wonder about people. What makes them so strange? Some people just ignore logic entirely. I really don\'t understand.<br /><br />And I\'m not a fool. I think some people take me for granted. <br />I wish you would show me a little bit of the respect I deserve. I wish you would give me higher regards than you currently do. Because even though you confuse me, my self-confidence protects me. I don\'t need your acceptance to feel self-worth. I work hard for my dignity, and I invest into it things that won\'t abandon me by occasion like a person would. <br /><br />I\'m independent. And I\'m glad for the way that I am. I don\'t need someone to tell me I\'m cool. I don\'t need to do the things kids my age do to feel good about myself. I\'m not talking about drugs or alcohol, but even then, I never plan on smoking; I never plan on drinking--only because I\'ve made that choice, and it\'s a good choice. If someone thinks it\'s unreasonable, why would I care? Only I know what\'s best for myself!<br /><br />I wish all of you thought like that. Why can\'t you make wise decisions? Why can\'t you only do the things that have positive influences on you? It\'s really not that hard! To me, making an unwise decision is much harder than doing the smart thing! Now obviously I make unwise decisions all the time, but I <i>develop</i> the skills to make good decisions. And the bad decisions that I do make aren\'t life-changing such as the issues I\'m talking about. <br /><br />I think I know a lot more than people think of me a lot of the time. <br />Because I\'m balanced. Balance is important to me. It\'s one of the biggest parts to enjoying life. I work hard in school, but it is not my life. I am very social, but I don\'t ignore my responsibilities. I work, but it doesn\'t control my time. I\'m athletic, but I don\'t work out 5 hours a day. I\'m loud and fun at times, but many times I\'m very, very quiet. I relax, but I don\'t sit in front of the TV all day. I spend time with my friends, but I also love my family. <br /><br />And I know YOU\'RE the shit, but you don\'t have to treat me like it. This is why you don\'t make sense to me. Why can\'t you just give up what destroys you and let me teach you? You\'re just so....so...ugh!<br /><br />I\'m confident for college, yet I wonder if it will be totally different than I\'m expecting. I want to meet someone, but considering how many meaningful people I\'ve met so far, how can I expect that time will tell and work that out on its own? There are no guarantees in life. Not even death or taxes.<br /><br /><br />I can wait; I can wait. I can sit wondering what in world you think about, but I don\'t think I\'m ever going to figure it out<br /><br />It\'s like some wild last frontier. You never know what kind of fight\'s going to appear. That once begun cannot be won. I started out losing already and go all ten rounds.

I&nbsp;get that kind of love from my friends at home, and I am truly inspired by it. I try to be a good friend. I try to be that type of person that people just really love to be around. I don\'t think it\'s difficult to do. If you love to be around those people and they can feel that, then they will treat you the same way. They will love to be around you and you will love to be around them, regardless of who they are or how well you know each other. That\'s something I\'ve noticed and really think has made me a better person. I&nbsp;just find such joy in being around those people who care for me and treat me like I\'m someone special. And I of course, return that favor. Life is not about happiness; life is not about money; life is not about possessions or accomplishments or talent; life is about relationships. Life is about loving each and every day for exactly what it is, regardless of what it is, and loving all of the people who come into your life. So then why can\'t I&nbsp;find that kind of unjudging and unbiased love in somebody special? I&nbsp;feel like that\'s what I offer. I&nbsp;didn\'t know it would be so hard to find. And I really feel like I\'m at a point in my life that I need, that I want it. I&nbsp;guess I just have no other option than to keep looking. <br /><br /><br />Something very strange happened to me today. I&nbsp;went to a friend\'s graduation party in our old neighborhood. His name is Paul. We lived next to him and his brother about ten years ago and played with them all the time as kids, so it was fun to just go and say hey for the day. Of course, he had tons of friends over, and neither I, nor my brother knew any of them. I was sitting outside on a wall next to the garage and this girl walks up to me and just starts rubbing my knees. I was kind of taken aback and just looked at her. Then, not knowing what to do, I&nbsp;said, &quot;Hi, I\'m Russell.&quot; She introduced herself, but being distracted with the overall oddity of the situation, I don\'t even remember her name. We talked for a few minutes, and she introduced me to a few of her friends. Soon, a friend came up to her and told her that it was time to go. She hugged me, kissed me on the cheek, ruffled my hair, and left. I&nbsp;didn\'t really know what to think. I didn\'t even know who this girl was. And I didn\'t even talk to her for 5 minutes. At a late night party, I probably wouldn\'t give it a second thought, but this was in broad daylight surrounded by so many people that I didn\'t even know. It just seemed a little strange and unexpected, I guess.<br />','Love without requirements.','','publish','open','open','','love-without-requirements','','','2009-05-25 01:49:00','2009-05-25 01:49:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=455',0,'post','',18),(456,2,'2009-05-25 20:21:00','2009-05-25 20:21:00','I&nbsp;feel so fucking rejected.

Take a look at me right now! This isn\'t going to change! You think you\'re better than me? You think you\'re all mature and developed? Your eyes have seen things I haven\'t? You have experienced things that I don\'t yet know? Get over yourself. God damnit, get over yourself! I\'m not changing. I was the same person I am now four years ago, and I will be the same person I am in four years from now. I don\'t need your demeaning thoughts and comments. I am an intelligent person, and I know how these types of things work. You\'re damaged. You\'re insecure. You\'re in need. You find other things to blame that on. Now I may be damaged and insecure just the same, but I\'m not like you. I didn\'t make the decisions you made. I\'m a different person, and I have walked a completely different path. Don\'t you dare tell me I\'m young. Don\'t you dare tell me I don\'t know the kinds of things that I will go through in the next few years. Just because I don\'t know what the future brings, just because I don\'t know what comes next, just because I don\'t know what my life will be like next year doesn\'t mean that you know that ANY better than you know that about yourself OR for me. The more you let your mouth run on, the more I can tell that you know nothing about me. God damn, it just makes me want to scream! This could be so beautiful. We could be something amazing. Instead, I have to use you as the stone I sharpen myself against. Your eyes are just a match I used to set myself on fire. Instead of a summer full of happy nights and meaningful conversations and keeping myself up late at night, I am intensely refining my own spirit. I am refining my own spirit, endlessly meditating on my life, who I am, and where I\'m going, going to every source I can possibly think of to determine exactly who I am and what I have in store for me. And naturally, I am <em>still</em> clueless. But you know what? I DO know one thing. I know that you\'re wrong about me. I know that you haven\'t got a clue about who I am. I know that I\'m NOT completely wrong about you. I\'m not completely clueless. Don\'t tell me we\'re not in the same stage of life. If we\'re not in the same stage of life, then it\'s because I\'ve passed you. It\'s because I\'ve passed you, and I am well on my way to be exactly who God has chosen for me to be. He\'s walking right there with me, every step of the way, and guiding my every move. And it\'s mutual. It\'s intricate; it\'s involved; it\'s elaborate; it takes time. My spirit is changing. My spirit is developing. I\'m becoming a much better person. I never could have believed one year ago that you could do this to me. I <em>never</em> could have believed I would meet someone who would awaken my soul into this new, changing, evolving relationship with my Father. It\'s deeply rooted, and the roots are growing ever deeper, into my mind, into my very, most inner being, as far into my soul as can be. And it\'s all thanks to you. I&nbsp;have never been this close to my Maker. You know what? Screw you. I love you, but you\'ve induced one hell of a battle within me. I never could have guessed that I ever would have changed this much. I\'m so extremely thankful for where I am, where I\'ve been, and where I\'m going. This must be what they call life to the fullest. Is life to the full being happy? No. That\'s completely wrong. That\'s completely out. That\'s not even close. Life to the full is filled entirely with all that comes in life: pain, suffering, sadness, death, grief, confusion, frustration, hurt, loneliness, loss. Suffering is what sharpens us. Suffering is what changes us. Suffering is what forces us to be the best that we can be. I\'ve learned so much. I\'ve learned so much that not even the greatest educational institutions on our planet could ever teach me, not even after lifetimes of the most focused and intensive study. And I\'m so glad for that. I can only pray that I will continue to develop like this. I can only pray that God will deliver me to exactly where he wants me to be. There\'s no other place that I want to be. There\'s no other thing I want more. There\'s no other thing in life that I want. There\'s no other thing in this world that will give me that fulfillment, and it has taken an emotional emergency to make me realize that. God, you must never let that change. You must never allow me to become comfortable and push you out of the way. You must never let my will become headstrong. You must let your desire become the overflow of my heart. Only that will fulfill my emptiness. I can never thank you enough for what you given me and the wisdom that you have presented me with. You could not have given me any greater reward. I pray that you will continue to instill in me this wisdom that will guide my thoughts and my life. I can never ask you enough. <br /><br />And for you? I have no idea where the hell you are taking this. You are only dragging me through the mud and leading me down a road with more suffering. You are only keeping me from being the happy and beautiful person I want to be. Now everyday I say to myself that if it works out, there will be little that could keep it from being worth it. But that\'s where the problem comes from. I have no guarantee that anything will work. I have no guarantee that I will not continue to get dragged through the mud and left alone to nurse all of my own wounds and emotional instabilities. So what the hell should I do? Lord, you must protect me. You must keep me under close watch and guard me from anything that is not in my best interest. Kristen, you are just so unspeakably beautiful, both inside and out, but I MUST watch my own back. I MUST not open myself up to someone that does not have my trust, does not love me for who I am, does not know who she is or even where she\'s going. I can try to guide you, but if you will not let me, that cannot happen. So here I have come--come to this fork in the road that will lead me only God knows where. To be honest, there are so many forks in the road that I have no idea their number, nor do I have a clue even in the slightest where a single one of them goes. I will have no choice but to continue to blindly walk through each day as it comes letting only the light of my life and source of my inspiration guide me. I am blind and have no better option. I am blind and emotionally overwhelmed. I am blind and letting my scarred spirit be guided. Now please, just take me where I am to be. <br />','No greater reward.','','publish','open','open','pickle','no-greater-reward','','','2009-05-26 02:26:00','2009-05-26 02:26:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=458',0,'post','',0),(459,2,'2009-05-27 21:52:00','2009-05-27 21:52:00','There was once a boy named Russell who didn\'t know what to do with himself -- not just sometimes, but always.<br /><br />When he was in school he longed to be out, and when he was out he longed to be in. On the way he thought about coming home, and coming home he thought about going. Wherever he was he wished he were somewhere else, and when he got there he wondered why he\'d bothered. Nothing really interested him -- least of all the things that should have.<br /><br />&quot;It seems to me that almost everything is a waste of time,&quot; he remarked one day as he walked dejectedly home from school. &quot;I can\'t see the point in learning to solve useless problems, or subtracting turnips from turnips, or knowing where Ethiopia is or how to spell February.&quot; And, since no one bothered to explain otherwise, he regarded the process of seeking knowledge as the greatest waste of time of all.<br /><br />As he and his unhappy thoughts hurried along (for while he was never anxious to be where he was going, he liked to get there as quickly as possible) it seemed a great wonder that the world, which was so large, could sometimes feel so small and empty.<br /><br />&quot;And worst of all,&quot; he continued sadly, &quot;there\'s nothing for me to do, nowhere I\'d care to go, and hardly anything worth seeing.&quot; He punctuated this last thought with such a deep sigh that a house sparrow singing nearby stopped and rushed home to be with his family.<br /><br />Without stopping or looking up, Russell dashed past the buildings and busy shops that lined the street and in a few minutes reached home -- dashed through the lobby -- hopped onto the elevator -- two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and off again -- opened the apartment door -- rushed into his room -- flopped dejectedly into a chair, and grumbled softly, &quot;Another long afternoon.&quot;<br /><br />He looked glumly at all the things he owned. The books that were too much trouble to read, the tools he\'d never learned to use, the small electric automobile he hadn\'t driven in months -- or was it years? -- and the hundreds of other games and toys, and bats and balls, and bits and pieces scattered around him. And then, to one side of the room, just next to the phonograph, he noticed something he had certainly never seen before.<br /><br />Who could possibly have left such an enormous package and such a strange one? For, while it was not quite square, it was definitely not round, and for its size it was larger than almost any other big package of smaller dimension that he\'d ever seen.<br /><br />Attached to one side was a bright-blue envelope which said simple: &quot;FOR RUSSELL, WHO HAS PLENTY OF TIME.&quot;<br /><br />Of course, if you\'ve ever gotten a surprise package, you can imagine how puzzled and excited Russell was; and if you\'ve never gotten one, pay close attention, because someday you might.<br /><br />&quot;I don\'t think it\'s my birthday,&quot; he puzzled, &quot;and Christmas must be months away, and I haven\'t been outstandingly good, or even good at all.&quot; (He had to admit this even to himself.) &quot;Most probably I won\'t like it anyway, but since I don\'t know where it came from, I can\'t possibly send it back.&quot; He thought about it for quite a while and then opened the envelope, but just to be polite.<br /><br />&quot;ONE GENUINE TURNPIKE TOLLBOOTH,&quot; it stated -- and then it went on:<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\">&quot;EASILY ASSEMBLED AT HOME, AND FOR USE BY THOSE WHO HAVE NEVER TRAVELED IN LANDS BEYOND.&quot;</div><br />&quot;Beyond what?&quot; thought Russell as he continued to read.<br /><br />&quot;THIS PACKAGE CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING ITEMS:<br /><br />-&quot;One (1) genuine turnpike tollbooth to be erected according to directions.<br />-&quot;Three (3) precautionary signs to be used in a precautionary fashion.<br />-&quot;Assorted coins for use in paying tolls.<br />-&quot;One (1) map, up to date and carefully drawn by master cartographers, depicting natural and man-made features.<br />-&quot;One (1) book of rules and traffic regulations, which may not be bent or broken.&quot;<br /><br />And in smaller letters at the bottom it concluded:<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\">&quot;RESULTS ARE NOT GUARANTEED, BUT IF NOT PERFECTLY SATISFIED, YOUR WASTED TIME WILL BE REFUNDED.&quot;</div><br />Following the instructions, which told him to cut here, lift there, and fold back all around, he soon had the toll booth unpacked and set up on its stand. He fitted the windows in place and attached the roof, which extended out on both sides, and fastened on the coin box. It was very much like the tollbooths he\'d seen many times on family trips, except of course it was much smaller and purple.<br /><br />&quot;What a strange present,&quot; he thought to himself. &quot;The least they could have done was to send a highway with it, for it\'s terribly impractical without one.&quot; But since, at the time, there was nothing else he wanted to play with, he set up the three signs,<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><br />SLOW DOWN APPROACHING TOLLBOOTH<br />PLEASE HAVE YOUR FARE READY<br />HAVE YOUR DESTINATION IN MIND</div><br />and slowly unfolded the map.<br /><br />As the announcement stated, it was a beautiful map, in many colors, showing principal roads, rivers and seas, towns and cities, mountains and valleys, intersections and detours, and sites of outstanding interest both beautiful and historic.<br /><br />The only trouble was that Russell had never heard of any of the places it indicated, and even the names sounded most peculiar.<br /><br />&quot;I don\'t think there really is such a country,&quot; he concluded after studying it carefully. &quot;Well, it doesn\'t matter anyway.&quot; And he closed his eyes and poked a finger at the map.<br /><br />&quot;Dictionopolis,&quot; read Russell slowly when he saw what his finger had chosen. &quot;Oh, well, I might as well go there as anywhere.&quot;<br /><br />He walked across the room and dusted the car off carefully. Then, taking the map and rule book with him, he hopped in and, for lack of anything better to do, drove slowly up to the tollbooth. As he deposited his coin and rolled past he remarked wistfully, &quot;I do hope this is an interesting game, otherwise the afternoon will be so terribly dull.&quot;','Dissatisfaction.','','publish','open','open','','dissatisfaction','','','2009-05-27 21:52:00','2009-05-27 21:52:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=459',0,'post','',36),(460,2,'2009-05-31 00:08:00','2009-05-31 00:08:00','<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v118/BuddyofSponge/tybeeisland.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>They\'re giving you a black eye&mdash;carousing shamelessly, grabbing anything that isn\'t nailed down.

Not only did I get plenty of rest, I also went to Wal-Mart to get an awesome new cruiser bike to put my bike engine on. The other one just didn\'t cut it. Nothing about it fit. It was one of the most frustrating things I\'ve ever done. And now I hoping that this new bike will work much better. and by better I mean actually work. I\'m optimistic and hoping that it will. I\'ll have to modify a few things, but think that they will go semi-smoothly, especially compared to last time. I got started transferring the motor today, and I think that it won\'t be anywhere near as hard this time around. It\'s just a matter of switching things around this time. I decided to document it the second time. <br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v118/BuddyofSponge/Moped/DSC_0009.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div><br />Here is the new bike I\'ll be putting it on. Awesome. Notice how extremely cruiser it is. Here it is, freshly brought home. I haven\'t even taken the tags off yet. I rode it around the block to see how it felt. The brakes are triggered by pedaling backwards, which makes me nervous, but I might also be able to add handbrake mechanisms, also. I \'ll just have to see how that pans out. It cost me 90 bucks, so at this point I\'m very nervous to do anything to mess it up before I actually know that everything will work with the motor. <br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v118/BuddyofSponge/Moped/DSC_0010.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div><br />Here is the beast that I\'m switching it with. It\'s totally awesome, but doesn\'t work, which isn\'t awesome. Every time I take it out, the tube pops, and I think that it\'s from a combination of the back fork not being big enough, me not installing the back cog correctly, and the back wheel sucking. This was an awesome 50 year old bike, and I wish I hadn\'t ruined it with the engine. Maybe I\'ll try and get it back to working, but I\'m pretty sure it wouldn\'t be worth all of the work. And <em>definitely </em>wouldn\'t be worth putting any money into it. <br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v118/BuddyofSponge/Moped/DSC_0011.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>And here they are,side by side, ready for their transplant.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v118/BuddyofSponge/Moped/DSC_0012.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>I don\'t know what this black bar is. Apparently, it\'s just a reinforcer that will keep the wheel steady, but it\'s in the way for the cog to go in place. It worried me at first, but I took it off without any problems and without much difficulty after playing with it for a minute. <br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v118/BuddyofSponge/Moped/DSC_0013.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>The motor. Notice the bent pedals. That\'s what I had to do so that the pedals could move around the motor--just another way this bike didn\'t fit with the motor. <br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v118/BuddyofSponge/Moped/DSC_0014.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>The back cog installed and working. The tube is popped and would pop every time I rode it. There were also no brakes, front or back. <br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v118/BuddyofSponge/Moped/DSC_0015.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>The chain was not attached, and I could never get it to work because of the pedals, having to shorten it, and the sucky back wheel.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v118/BuddyofSponge/Moped/DSC_0017.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div><br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v118/BuddyofSponge/Moped/DSC_0018.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><br />&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v118/BuddyofSponge/Moped/DSC_0019.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>It is a single speed. Awesome. I think it will give me a low enough gear ratio to easily pedal-start the motor, which I couldn\'t do with the green one. I later had to remove the fender since it was in the way of the motor chain, but hopefully later I will be able to modify it and put it back on for wet roads.<br /><br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v118/BuddyofSponge/Moped/DSC_0020.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>A closer look at the back pedal-gear.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v118/BuddyofSponge/Moped/DSC_0022.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>Later, I removed all of the tags and ugly Huffy stickers. <br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v118/BuddyofSponge/Moped/DSC_0023.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>I got the black bar off the wheel and soon was ready to start putting on the motor gear on it. <br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v118/BuddyofSponge/Moped/DSC_0024.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>Here\'s where it goes. The hole on the cog wasn\'t big enough, so I found the dremel and got to work. <br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v118/BuddyofSponge/Moped/DSC_0025.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>It was extremely time consuming. But it worked and that\'s all that matters. It was a pretty boot leg job, but I don\'t think it will cause too many problems. <br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v118/BuddyofSponge/Moped/DSC_0026.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><br />&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v118/BuddyofSponge/Moped/DSC_0027.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>This piece is will cause the biggest problems on the bike. It will bend and get shaved away and cause huge problems. Hopefully this time this will not be the case. It covers the ball bearings. It\'s what I\'m most worried about. I had to make the hole in the gear big enough for it to fit through. <br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v118/BuddyofSponge/Moped/DSC_0028.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>My weapon of choice. I would much, much rather have something much more efficient and accurate (and safe), but alas, I have nothing, so this dremel is what I had to use. <br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v118/BuddyofSponge/Moped/DSC_0029.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>I finally got it to fit!<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v118/BuddyofSponge/Moped/DSC_0030.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>After about an hour of tedious and painstaking dremeling, I finally got the hole big enough. <br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v118/BuddyofSponge/Moped/DSC_0031.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>I finally got the back gear on! I think (hope) it will work well. In all, this is the hardest and most sensitive part of building the moped. If I\'m lucky, this will work, and if this will work, the whole moped will work. <br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v118/BuddyofSponge/Moped/DSC_0032.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>The black axel ring does not look too good. It looks crooked and rubs the gear. This could mean big trouble. I rode it around to see if it would affect it, and it didn\'t, so hopefully when I\'m going 40 mph on the motor, this will also be true. I\'m not sure what to think, but I guess we\'ll see soon enough. <br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v118/BuddyofSponge/Moped/DSC_0033.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>The back cog is on and as true as I can possibly get it. It was a pain, but I installed it correctly this time--as much as I could--and it\'s time to called it a day. I was tired and didn\'t have the materials to mount the motor yet. <br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v118/BuddyofSponge/Moped/DSC_0034.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>The motor fit the frame on the green bike very well, so I didn\'t have to drill a hole in the frame to mount it. This isn\'t the case with the new one. I don\'t have what I need to do that, so I\'ll make a trip to Home Depot tomorrow and see what I can do. Once I find a way to mount the motor, there won\'t be much work left to do, so I may have the bike running before long. Things are working out much better this time around, and I\'ll get pictures the rest of the way, too. I\'m pretty pumped to have this thing functional. It worked on the green bike--the motor spun, but was NOT functional.

Just improvise for a little bit. Why do you have to know what tomorrow will be like anyway? Why does it matter? Just go with today. <br /><br />You\'ve got the upper hand. Use it to push yourself up. Use it to feed your own arrogance. Because you sure have done a good job with that so far. Everything happens for a reason. You meet every person for a reason. How can you do anything else but focus on the wrong path when you\'re looking straight at the ground?<br /><br />But certainly don\'t change your strategy. Keep laying your foundations thick and sturdy. Don\'t get distracted by the huge steak on the line in front of you. You\'ll never catch it. It will never satisfy. It fools you....it\'s so close! Plan ahead and stick with it. Don\'t ruin something good. Don\'t be tricked into following the wrong cues. Be yourself and keep what you\'ve brought with you. Don\'t change at all. People admire you for that, you know. Even if you can\'t see it. Live for the summer nights and the beauty that has come your way. Sometimes the most unexpected things turn into something beautiful. And don\'t transfer your pain. Don\'t rebound your hurt. That\'s not fair at all. That\'s dirty. Keep your own problems and learn from them. Have a little respect for who wanders your way. That\'s the key word. Respect. It\'s valuable. Regardless of how you feel, walk carefully. Remain constant in a completely discontinuous world. Pray ahead of time. Prepare for the expected. Fight it. Use your past demons to escape the traps you know you will fall into. Cover your tracks. Distract yourself today with what\'s good now, and maybe one day you can concern yourself with what used to be. <br /><br /><em>My tea\'s gone cold--I\'m wondering why I got out of bed at all.

I\'m 20 years old, and I have lived in Gwinnett County since the day I was born. I\'ve always been proud of that until now. This past March, I was home from school for a week of Spring Break and glad to be to have a break from the intense academics that Georgia Tech offers. I had my friend over, Lee Bouldin, for the weekend--the last 3 days of Spring Break. He\'s from Connecticut, so we were showing him some of the awesome things about Gwinnett County over here in Dacula. We took him out to look at all the countryside and parked on the road to walk down to a creek we had been going to since we were children. The path followed down a power line easement to the creek a mile or two down the path. Before we got very far, some police officers came as we were walking down this big open path and told us we were trespassing. There were 2 officers and 3 of us: me, my friend Lee from Connecticut, and my other friend Dustin who is also from Gwinnett County. We politely told them that we weren\'t trying to cause trouble, only come down to see the creek and that we would gladly leave. They wouldn\'t have it. They were rude; they accused us of damage to the property; they didn\'t listen to what we had to say. They didn\'t care that we weren\'t causing trouble or being malicious. They didn\'t care that we were being polite and respectful. They disrespected us and disregarded any of our own wishes. It turns out the land we were on was part of the new Harbins Park that was opening the very next morning. It was about 4 o\'clock in the afternoon. After volunteering to leave or even to help make any preparations they needed to open the park the next morning, they decided that none of this was good enough and arrested us. We were not damaging the property. We were not doing drugs. We were not drinking alcohol. We were not making bonfires or with girls or driving any vehicles on the land--only walking down a path. Before one of the officers arrested us, he made us walk back with him to the car where he put his dirty bike in the back of our van and made us drive him to the entrance of the park. He then impounded our car which was not illegally parked and took us to jail. My parents were out of town and now my little brother who was at a friends house had no way to get home--nor did I know where I was. So now at this point after living 20 years and never receiving even a single disciplinary mark in school or any other institution, I\'m in jail. <br /><br />The GCPD\'s mission statement is to &quot;serve the community through the delivery of professional law enforcement services in an <strong>unbiased</strong> and <strong>compassionate</strong> manner in order to protect the lives and property of citizens and<strong> improve the quality of life </strong>in our community.&quot; I cringe when I read this. I wish it truly were the case. If the Gwinnett County Police department really were aiming to achieve this goal, then maybe I would still be able to hold a respect for them in my mind. Their values state that, &quot;We are committed to <strong>achieving the public\'s trust</strong> by holding ourselves accountable to the <strong>highest standards of professionalism and ethics</strong>,&quot; yet I cannot trust any police officer after dealing with this incident and being treated as I was treated. In all this incident has cost me about 700 dollars--not including what it cost my other two friends of which their fees were similar amounts--all for only walking down a power line for a few minutes. I\'m a college student working hard to make my way through a very difficult school and have no money to pay for nonsense like this. I have read all of the Georgia Code regarding our incident and still disagree with the consequences I have had to pay.<br /><br />I hope you will not take this as a biased opinion from a citizen who is bitter about going to jail, but from a scholar at the Institute, a future engineer of America, a citizen with intellect, and a young man who was once proud to be called a citizen of Gwinnett. I hope you feel some of the same things when reading this as I do and work hard to improve the poor quality of law enforcers in our county such as this one. Today, I am ashamed to be a resident of Gwinnett County.<br /><br /><br /><br />Yours truly,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Russell Strauss','Mistrust.','','publish','open','open','','mistrust','','','2009-07-29 13:09:00','2009-07-29 13:09:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=475',0,'post','',0),(476,2,'2009-08-04 15:26:00','2009-08-04 15:26:00','<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://pics.livejournal.com/rruffles/pic/000030zc\" /></div>She has no idea that she could make me do anything.

In only one week, summer will be over and we will no longer have this time to sleep, eat, relax, enjoy each day. We\'re about to jump in and be swept away. One unit is filled and we will move on to the next. I will look back as the relationships I&nbsp;developed, events I&nbsp;experienced, troubles I had, emotions I felt, and thoughts I reflected over will officially move into the folder labeled &quot;PAST.&quot; It\'s strange how each section of life is so visibly divided. I&nbsp;can look back and see a specific collection of people, thoughts, feelings, and experiences that connect with a certain time period in my life, all of which have a parallel set of songs that bring it back instantly. And now, over the next week, the collection of this summer and last six months are moving into the next section of the folder as I&nbsp;pull out more paper and an open mind for what comes next.<br /><br />So then, what <em>does</em> come next? Hmm. Not sure. Will it be a new day? Of course. Will it be a beautiful new day with a new set of joys and pains? Of course, and I&nbsp;cannot wait. My fists are in the air, and I\'m running into this with my eyes shut as tight as they will go! You\'ve enjoyed this glorious summer, and although it ends, you\'ve enjoyed every second of it, and you\'re ready. You\'re ready, and even though you may never believe it, the love that you give will someday return to you.

The long-term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists, whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience. I will dispense this advice now.\r\n\r\nEnjoy the power and beauty of your youth. Oh, never mind. You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they\'ve faded. But trust me, in 20 years, you\'ll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can\'t grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. You are not as fat as you imagine.\r\n\r\nDon\'t worry about the future. Or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind, the kind that blindside you at 4 p.m. on some idle Tuesday.\r\n\r\nDo one thing every day that scares you.\r\n\r\nSing.\r\n\r\nDon\'t be reckless with other people\'s hearts. Don\'t put up with people who are reckless with yours.\r\n\r\nFloss.\r\n\r\nDon\'t waste your time on jealousy. Sometimes you\'re ahead, sometimes you\'re behind. The race is long and, in the end, it\'s only with yourself.\r\n\r\nRemember compliments you receive. Forget the insults. If you succeed in doing this, tell me how.\r\n\r\nKeep your old love letters. Throw away your old bank statements.\r\n\r\nStretch.\r\n\r\nDon\'t feel guilty if you don\'t know what you want to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn\'t know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don\'t.\r\n\r\nGet plenty of calcium. Be kind to your knees. You\'ll miss them when they\'re gone.\r\n\r\nMaybe you\'ll marry, maybe you won\'t. Maybe you\'ll have children, maybe you won\'t. Maybe you\'ll divorce at 40, maybe you\'ll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary. Whatever you do, don\'t congratulate yourself too much, or berate yourself either. Your choices are half chance. So are everybody else\'s.\r\n\r\nEnjoy your body. Use it every way you can. Don\'t be afraid of it or of what other people think of it. It\'s the greatest instrument you\'ll ever own.\r\n\r\nDance, even if you have nowhere to do it but your living room.\r\n\r\nRead the directions, even if you don\'t follow them.\r\n\r\nDo not read beauty magazines. They will only make you feel ugly.\r\n\r\nGet to know your parents. You never know when they\'ll be gone for good. Be nice to your siblings. They\'re your best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future.\r\n\r\nUnderstand that friends come and go, but with a precious few you should hold on. Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle, because the older you get, the more you need the people who knew you when you were young.\r\n\r\nLive in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard. Live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft. Travel.\r\n\r\nAccept certain inalienable truths: Prices will rise. Politicians will philander. You, too, will get old. And when you do, you\'ll fantasize that when you were young, prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders.\r\n\r\nRespect your elders.\r\n\r\nDon\'t expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you have a trust fund. Maybe you\'ll have a wealthy spouse. But you never know when either one might run out.\r\n\r\nDon\'t mess too much with your hair or by the time you\'re 40 it will look 85.\r\n\r\nBe careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it. Advice is a form of nostalgia. Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it\'s worth.\r\n\r\nBut trust me on the sunscreen.','Don\'t be reckless with other people\'s hearts.

Thanksgiving is almost here, and within a few weeks, it will be over. I can\'t deny that it\'s been the best so far, and I know it will only get better. To savor every last bit, I will reflect back on the most memorable moments to date.\r\n\r\nThings that have happened this semester that I could never possibly forget:\r\n\r\nMoving into a ridiculously crazy apartment of guys, making sure to break every rule possible without getting caught. Living through it to not hate each other, but rather like each other even more.\r\n\r\nCovering the quad in paper airplanes. Multiple times. Then noticing that we had inspired others to simultaneously do the same.\r\n\r\nGoing on an epic twenty-mile bike ride with 400 others in Atlanta, making the mistake of giving Slay the Next. To say the least, we spent about 4 hours that night driving all over Atlanta trying to find him, knowing that he was surely being either a) butt raped, b) being killed, c) being kidnapped, or d) all of the above. Including but not limited to (no exaggeration here): calling 911, talking to hookers, being the only white people within a 5 mile radius, visiting every single Church\'s Chicken and Advanced Auto Parts all the way down Moreland, driving to and from Tech repeatedly, and playing phone tag with a lost, phoneless freshman that has no idea where he is. \r\n\r\nSpending many nights pondering the meaning of life over pipes, whether on the ground, at the lake, or on the roof. \r\n\r\nTaking a road trip to see truly the most epic concert imaginable, and quite possibly the highlight of the whole semester.\r\n\r\nGoing to Oglethorpe, being entertained by my room mates, then having nothing change despite anything that could have occurred. \r\n\r\nTaking Emory by storm with 200 people strong, including the guy with the dog in his bag. Unfortunately, we weren\'t in costume as we were with the October Mass.  \r\n\r\nGoing to watch shooting stars with nine extremely fun people, and not being disappointed at all, even if we did only see ten of them. Also, knowing that I was the only one to see the best one, by far. Being in my own yard, listening to the perfect soundtrack for the moment with so many wonderful people, surely the most perfect moment of the semester. Truly a movie moment.\r\n\r\nGoing to a barnyard dance with at least 50 Asians that I swear couldn\'t speak or understand English. Making Lee Taylor go up with me to be the example dancers in front of EVERYONE! So fun!!\r\n\r\nGetting to go to the biggest show I\'ve ever been to with my best friend while sitting no less in the FRONT ROW, and watch Travis Barker solo on a rotating, flying drum set. Being that close to people I thought I would never hear play music together again, and getting to see so many old friends that I love and miss. \r\n\r\nGetting to make it to every game of the season without paying a single penny for tickets. People may not care, but I am proud of my financial strategies. And I still have never seen my school lose a game.\r\n\r\nStorming the football field after one of the most momentous games in a long, long time and marching with half of the student body to the president\'s house. I shook his hand, and he told me to be safe. \r\n\r\nSeeing my sister get MARRIED, while not being able to hold it together in front of everyone, friends, family, relatives. Getting the chance to sing them the Mario Kart Love Song to begin their life together, and getting to dance my heart out with all of my friends back home that I had not seen in so very long and missed terribly. \r\n\r\nSurviving another semester while enjoying every second of it, even the hard times, and feeling accomplished at the end looking back on everything I did and created. \r\n\r\nVisiting UGA and being so extremely satisfied with my choice to come to this school, being solidified in my decision, and knowing that there is no where else I would rather be. \r\n\r\nDreading my unjustifiable $350 court date all semester, postponing it, then celebrating after it was dismissed due to the officer \"leaving the district.\"\r\n\r\nWrecking my bike, flying down freshman hill, everyone around crowding around me, yet somehow surviving, and then fixing the damages to what I thought surely should have a been much, much, much worse situation.\r\n\r\nGoing through my first ever corn maze, and acting like a child, despite the awkward circumstances. This includes getting to jump on the coolest trampoline I have ever experienced.\r\n\r\nWitnessing the Internet officially being declared dead with the October 26 shut down of Geocities. Then being completely appalled to find out that no one knows what Geocities is. And immediately being confused as to what school I was at again. \r\n\r\nBeing 20 years old and going trick or treating regardless. I had an amazing time and enjoyed every bit of the donuts, candy, and walking in the rain that we got that night. \r\n\r\nGetting to be one of the extremely few people at Six Flags after the flooding and riding every single ride with literally no line. I thought I had experienced, to that point, the Batman at the fastest it could possibly go. I was wrong. I met so many fun people, too.\r\n\r\nExperience the death that is LCC 2700, but loving all the people that were in it with me. Then discussing what new horridities had come up with the entire class in 2720.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe semester is not quite over yet, and I feel that the best is still yet to come. I cannot wait to go home and to see all of my friends and family for Christmas and Thanksgiving, both my favorite times of the year, and I get extremely excited just thinking of the things we\'re going to do.

At least, that&rsquo;s the buzz among efficiency mavens, who seem to spend all their time adding up microblogging&rsquo;s fiscal toll. Last year, Nucleus Research warned that Facebook shaves 1.5 percent off total office productivity; a Morse survey estimated that on-the-job social networking costs British companies $2.2 billion a year.<br /><br />But for knowledge workers charged with transforming ideas into products &mdash; whether gadgets, code, or even Wired articles &mdash; goofing off isn&rsquo;t the enemy. In fact, regularly stepping back from the project at hand can be essential to success. And social networks are particularly well suited to stoking the creative mind.<br /><br />Studies that accuse social networks of reducing productivity assume that time spent microblogging is time strictly wasted. But that betrays an ignorance of the creative process. Humans weren&rsquo;t designed to maintain a constant focus on assigned tasks. We need periodic breaks to relieve our conscious minds of the pressure to perform &mdash; pressure that can lock us into a single mode of thinking. Musing about something else for a while can clear away the mental detritus, letting us see an issue through fresh eyes, a process that creativity researchers call incubation. &ldquo;People are more successful if we force them to move away from a problem or distract them temporarily,&rdquo; observe the authors of Creativity and the Mind, a landmark text in the psychology and neuroscience of creativity. They found that regular breaks enhance problem-solving skills significantly, in part by making it easier for workers to sift through their memories in search of relevant clues.<br /><br />That doesn&rsquo;t mean that employees should feel free to play Minesweeper at will, however. According to Don Ambrose, a Rider University professor who studies creative intelligence, incubation is most effective when it involves exposing the mind to entirely novel information rather than just relieving mental pressure. This encourages creative association, the mashing together of seemingly unrelated concepts &mdash; a key step in the creative process.<br /><br />History is full of tales of revelations that were helped along by such conceptual collisions. Alastair Pilkington came up with the idea for float glass, the inexpensive successor to plate glass, while washing dishes; the grease that pooled atop the water inspired him to pour molten glass onto melted tin, resulting in a perfectly smooth pane. And George de Mestral had the initial brainstorm for Velcro during a 1941 hunting trip, when he noticed how difficult it was to pick Alpine burrs off of his clothes.<br /><br />This means that tweets about Lady Gaga&rsquo;s lingerie can help someone debugging Perl code. (Or a tweet about Perl code may help Lady Gaga&rsquo;s underwear stylist.) A random scrap of information can trigger just the right conceptual collision. It&rsquo;s hard to know which scrap might do the trick, but that&rsquo;s the beauty of social networks &mdash; they constantly produce potential sparks, for free.<br /><br />The participatory nature of Twitter and Facebook also makes them excellent tools for supercharging creativity. Users finely craft their bons mots to grab people&rsquo;s attention and perhaps earn a retweet or two.<br /><br />As football coaches have long preached, you should practice like you play. Twitter and Facebook give knowledge workers the chance to turn downtime into a game where creativity and insight are rewarded, if only with digital pats on the back. Formulating a clever tweet about the latest Clipse record may not have much to do with an engineer&rsquo;s current project, but it demands far more inspired energy than reading the sports page. And didn&rsquo;t someone awfully smart once note that excellence, whether intellectual or physical, was a habit?<br /><br />Ah, right &mdash; it was @THE_REAL_SHAQ. Hmm, wonder what he&rsquo;s tweeting right now? Let me check.<br /><div style=\"text-align: right;\">-<em>Wired Magazine</em></div>','creative efficiency','','publish','open','open','','creative-efficiency','','','2017-04-26 15:06:32','2017-04-26 19:06:32','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=501',0,'post','',0),(502,2,'2010-03-08 00:24:00','2010-03-08 00:24:00','It\'s absolutely outrageous how cute you are.

And if it\'s not in my control then who is to know however long I&nbsp;will be alone!&nbsp;Will I ever find someone to be happy with? Will I&nbsp;ever find someone good enough that see something special in me? Will I ever find someone who sees something special in me at all?

I\'m so satisfied with my life, but I want the perfect person to share it with. Something comfortable. Something beautiful. Something soothing, and something refreshing. \r\n\r\nSo what am I doing wrong? Not even a hint.

Our happiness at  any given point is dictated by the fickle flow of chemicals in our  brain, serving as a barrier keeping us from satisfaction in life, almost  impossible to break free from. One night I\'m happy as can be, loving my  place on Earth, grateful for my blessings, thankful for where I&nbsp;am, the  next I\'m wanting, frustrated, dissatisfied, trying to remember how it  was that I&nbsp;felt so fine. I&nbsp;try to bottle up my contentment to save it  for another time, but there\'s just no way to do it. The next day comes,  the clouds take over the sky, and I&nbsp;have no way of escaping my  dreariness. We have no reason to feel this way. We\'re always looking for  more: a bigger room, more free time, an easier life, better friends.  Why can\'t we be content with our life right now? I&nbsp;am now. But will I&nbsp;be  tomorrow? There\'s no telling. I\'m left helpless to my emotions, dragged  around by the collar around my neck, trying to enjoy what I&nbsp;can. \r\n\r\nIt\'s a  beautiful night, but why don\'t I&nbsp;feel that way constantly? What makes  any night less beautiful than the others? Life is a wonderful experience  that we all take for granted. Yet, at the same time, I&nbsp;get sick of the  optimism. The words become clich&eacute;, expressing only temporary feelings of  sentiment. I&nbsp;can see that you are happy with  your life right now. I&nbsp;can see that you see  life as beautiful. I&nbsp;don\'t care. Your strong  pangs of optimism don\'t contribute any solution to my ever swaying  emotions. \r\n\r\nLife doesn\'t demand that we understand. Just enjoy it.\r\n\r\nI&nbsp;try to live by this. I&nbsp;try  to just enjoy it. Normally, I\'m successful. But mostly, I get  distracted.

The  cost of being sinful is to die, and God\'s love is everlasting.  Therefore, since we are sinful, we deserve death rather than life. They  say that we\'re no good, we always do wrong, we always disobey God\'s  instruction, we\'re defective on the inside, and emphasize the fact that  we will never be good enough for God\'s love, which is nothing short of  perfect. These Christians are wrong.<br /><br />God gave us the gift of  exclusion from this death. A gift by definition is something you  deserve. You can give a gift to someone undeserving, but by doing that,  you declare that they deserve it. Whether it\'s what they\'ve done for  you, how they\'ve made you feel, how much you love them, or just of your  own mercy, you give it to them because you want them to have it. <br /><br />If  I&nbsp;decide to give something to my mom for  Mother\'s Day, I&nbsp;think it through, think of all  the reasons why I&nbsp;want her to have it, and  specifically choose what exactly I&nbsp;want to  give her. I\'ve put this effort into my gift to express my love, and I\'m  excited for her to have it. Also, I&nbsp;want her  to enjoy it, for if she didn\'t, it would defeat the purpose of giving her a  gift. The day comes for me to give her my gift, carefully chosen, but  she won\'t accept it. She feels that she doesn\'t deserve it, that she has  no reason to take it. I\'m offended and hurt. I&nbsp;spent  that time giving her something yet she won\'t take it. <br /><br />God gives  us a gift of life, but some say that we are &quot;sinful,&quot; &quot;undeserving,&quot; or  &quot;unworthy.&quot; All of us have accepted that life already, so then, why do  you say that we aren\'t worthy of God\'s love or that we deserve only  death from our sin if you\'ve already accepted it? We deserve that life  based on the nature of that gift and the statement of approval God has  given to us in giving it to us. Never do we have to say that we aren\'t  good enough or that we are horrible people or that we are messed up. We  are exactly the way God created us and deserving of his love as his  creation.<br /><br /><em><br />On the morning of a day that I should love and the start of the Spring, my day was snowed in. <br /> So I rushed you off the phone: how should I have known it was the last I\'d hear your voice telling me goodbye? <br />Pulling a blanket up to cover everyone, all shut out, I was wrapped up in myself and my guilt. <br />Now I\'m not holding on, but I can\'t let go.

Sure, tomorrow I&nbsp;will feel great. But you cannot leave me to rest on these faltering emotions that sway more strongly than the waves of the sea.

Of course the human will can form an optimism that will get us through any situation. That\'s no surprise. I\'m not stupid. But is that all you offer? Your words surely do not offer any comfort outside of the reaches of my own mind. Nothing but elaborate self assurance. I&nbsp;am disappointed at your lack of actuality. I&nbsp;truly do believe that I&nbsp;will be forced to follow you blindly to my death, and that eternally frustrates me. You call us to a radical life, yet give us nothing radical. You call us to live with undying faith, but provide us with only internal insignificance. I&nbsp;don\'t ask for things selfishly. I&nbsp;don\'t ask for the world, but you designed me to want the world, with no means of escape from that desire.

There are points where you truly understand how things work, though just for a moment, and return to your life from the moment refreshed and confident on where you are.

Why is it so hard to find good friends who need you just as much as you need them? This will forever be my dilemma. I need relationships to get me through my life, yet these are the relationships that fail me. These are the relationships I don\'t make. These are the relationships I can\'t even find. As a result, I pour my efforts and my time into unloyal friends who have no concern for my own well-being.\r\n\r\nWhy do you mock me? Are my requests that difficult? Are they that complicated? No. They\'re not. All I\'ve ever wanted is so simple. I\'m very easy to please, very easy to satisfy, so then why is it so ceaselessly impossible to satisfy my simple desires? They can all be met through the people in my life. I care for others with the same unending loyalty that I need in my own life, yet I seem to be the only one who knows how to care for others this way. I am unfulfilled. I am unsatisfied. I am insanely frustrated. Why are others not straight-forward like I am?\r\n\r\nI continuously journal about the same issue over and over again: someone to give meaning to my life. Yet that person is no where in sight. Waiting for that person I can deal with. What I cannot deal with is not having others to fill that void until then. I don\'t want a lot. I just want anybody. Why is that so difficult?\r\n\r\nIt\'s pathetic how this is even an issue. I\'m confident that this is not because of who I am. Quality people should be attracted to me. So then, why are they not? Is it where I am? If so, why should I have to deal with that? Why is everyone else having such a good time while I work hard and work to forget my unfulfillment? I will sit here, frustrated, and move my mind onto other things to ignore my worries. I am too angry to say what I want, too angry to understand my problems.\r\n\r\nYou piss me off.\r\nYou make me so mad.\r\nStop calling me your friend.\r\nGet away from me.\r\n\r\nI don\'t listen to myself sometimes. I realize that I\'m better off pushing people away than staying at a far distance, hoping they will come closer, yet I have too much hope. I\'m sick of you taunting me. I\'m done with you.

What a buzz kill. Out of all the things you cold have said, is that really what I needed to hear? I had such a wonderful night. I was so hopeful. I like you so much. Regardless, I will not let my hope fall. I will push onward, and I will continue with the steadfast motivation that has formed my life to this point. I want you so bad. I want you so bad, Hannah, and I don\'t even care what it takes. I don\'t care if it takes waiting around forever. I don\'t care if it takes making a fool of myself. I don\'t care if it takes doing things I\'m not comfortable with at all. I just want you. You\'re perfect for me. Please realize that. I will continue to try and convince you of that. I wish I could get inside your head. I wish I could get inside your head and know what it takes. I don\'t think I\'ve ever been so motivated.\r\n\r\nAll of my emotions lately have been so intense. They been so intense and so concentrated. When I\'ve been confident, I\'ve been SO confident. When I\'ve been happy, I\'ve worried of nothing else. When I\'ve felt discouraged, I\'ve focused on nothing until I displaced that discouragement. My mind has opened to new things. \r\n\r\nBut I look ahead. I want my life to converge. I want to meet someone to make my life meaningful. Yet when I say that, I don\'t mean \"meet.\" I mean \"convince.\" I drink another beer to forget. I drink another beer to replace that buzz kill with confidence. Why don\'t you see this in me? The beer will help me to speak my mind. Maybe tomorrow it will sound silly. Right now, I don\'t care. I\'m in love and whether I will admit that tomorrow or not, it\'s true. Whether I would tell my completely sober self, it\'s true. The films I watch convince me of it.\r\n\r\nLife is beautiful. When I watch a beautiful film, I feel it. When the sun shines, I feel it. When the alcohol redirects my thought, I feel it. Yet I still do not know how I will feel tomorrow of my thoughts tonight. I respect them for the stream of consciousness the drink gives me. All I really want right now is someone to talk to. My inhibitions have been pushed aside, and I don\'t care who that someone is. Someone I can express my thoughts upon, much like this LiveJournal has been to me over the years. \r\n\r\nI don\'t know how to deal with the situation I\'ve been given, yet the drunkenness of both the love and the beer null any negatives it brings. \r\n\r\nWow.

In the future, I think that the Yuengling will offer much more to my expression that I have struggled to present in the past. Only time will tell.\r\n\r\nI love you.

She doesn\'t stand out in any way. Her clothes are nothing special. The back of her hair is still bent out of shape from sleep. She isn\'t young, either - must be near thirty, not even close to a \"girl,\" properly speaking. But still, I know from fifty yards away: She\'s the 100% perfect girl for me. The moment I see her, there\'s a rumbling in my chest, and my mouth is as dry as a desert.\r\n\r\nMaybe you have your own particular favorite type of girl - one with slim ankles, say, or big eyes, or graceful fingers, or you\'re drawn for no good reason to girls who take their time with every meal. I have my own preferences, of course. Sometimes in a restaurant I\'ll catch myself staring at the girl at the next table to mine because I like the shape of her nose.\r\n\r\nBut no one can insist that his 100% perfect girl correspond to some preconceived type. Much as I like noses, I can\'t recall the shape of hers - or even if she had one. All I can remember for sure is that she was no great beauty. It\'s weird.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday on the street I passed the 100% girl,\" I tell someone.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah?\" he says. \"Good-looking?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not really.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your favorite type, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don\'t know. I can\'t seem to remember anything about her - the shape of her eyes or the size of her breasts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Strange.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah. Strange.\"\r\n\r\n\"So anyhow,\" he says, already bored, \"what did you do? Talk to her? Follow her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nah. Just passed her on the street.\"\r\n\r\nShe\'s walking east to west, and I west to east. It\'s a really nice April morning.\r\n\r\nWish I could talk to her. Half an hour would be plenty: just ask her about herself, tell her about myself, and - what I\'d really like to do - explain to her the complexities of fate that have led to our passing each other on a side street in Harajuku on a beautiful April morning in 1981. This was something sure to be crammed full of warm secrets, like an antique clock built when peace filled the world.\r\n\r\nAfter talking, we\'d have lunch somewhere, maybe see a Woody Allen movie, stop by a hotel bar for cocktails. With any kind of luck, we might end up in bed.\r\n\r\nPotentiality knocks on the door of my heart.\r\n\r\nNow the distance between us has narrowed to fifteen yards.\r\n\r\nHow can I approach her? What should I say?\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, miss. Do you think you could spare half an hour for a little conversation?\"\r\n\r\nRidiculous. I\'d sound like an insurance salesman.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, but would you happen to know if there is an all-night cleaners in the neighborhood?\"\r\n\r\nNo, this is just as ridiculous. I\'m not carrying any laundry, for one thing. Who\'s going to buy a line like that?\r\n\r\nMaybe the simple truth would do. \"Good morning. You are the 100% perfect girl for me.\"\r\n\r\nNo, she wouldn\'t believe it. Or even if she did, she might not want to talk to me. Sorry, she could say, I might be the 100% perfect girl for you, but you\'re not the 100% boy for me. It could happen. And if I found myself in that situation, I\'d probably go to pieces. I\'d never recover from the shock. I\'m thirty-two, and that\'s what growing older is all about.\r\n\r\nWe pass in front of a flower shop. A small, warm air mass touches my skin. The asphalt is damp, and I catch the scent of roses. I can\'t bring myself to speak to her. She wears a white sweater, and in her right hand she holds a crisp white envelope lacking only a stamp. So: She\'s written somebody a letter, maybe spent the whole night writing, to judge from the sleepy look in her eyes. The envelope could contain every secret she\'s ever had.\r\n\r\nI take a few more strides and turn: She\'s lost in the crowd.\r\n\r\nNow, of course, I know exactly what I should have said to her. It would have been a long speech, though, far too long for me to have delivered it properly. The ideas I come up with are never very practical.\r\n\r\nOh, well. It would have started \"Once upon a time\" and ended \"A sad story, don\'t you think?\"\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, there lived a boy and a girl. The boy was eighteen and the girl sixteen. He was not unusually handsome, and she was not especially beautiful. They were just an ordinary lonely boy and an ordinary lonely girl, like all the others. But they believed with their whole hearts that somewhere in the world there lived the 100% perfect boy and the 100% perfect girl for them. Yes, they believed in a miracle. And that miracle actually happened.\r\n\r\nOne day the two came upon each other on the corner of a street.\r\n\r\n\"This is amazing,\" he said. \"I\'ve been looking for you all my life. You may not believe this, but you\'re the 100% perfect girl for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you,\" she said to him, \"are the 100% perfect boy for me, exactly as I\'d pictured you in every detail. It\'s like a dream.\"\r\n\r\nThey sat on a park bench, held hands, and told each other their stories hour after hour. They were not lonely anymore. They had found and been found by their 100% perfect other. What a wonderful thing it is to find and be found by your 100% perfect other. It\'s a miracle, a cosmic miracle.\r\n\r\nAs they sat and talked, however, a tiny, tiny sliver of doubt took root in their hearts: Was it really all right for one\'s dreams to come true so easily?\r\n\r\nAnd so, when there came a momentary lull in their conversation, the boy said to the girl, \"Let\'s test ourselves - just once. If we really are each other\'s 100% perfect lovers, then sometime, somewhere, we will meet again without fail. And when that happens, and we know that we are the 100% perfect ones, we\'ll marry then and there. What do you think?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"that is exactly what we should do.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so they parted, she to the east, and he to the west.\r\n\r\nThe test they had agreed upon, however, was utterly unnecessary. They should never have undertaken it, because they really and truly were each other\'s 100% perfect lovers, and it was a miracle that they had ever met. But it was impossible for them to know this, young as they were. The cold, indifferent waves of fate proceeded to toss them unmercifully.\r\n\r\nOne winter, both the boy and the girl came down with the season\'s terrible influenza, and after drifting for weeks between life and death they lost all memory of their earlier years. When they awoke, their heads were as empty as the young D. H. Lawrence\'s piggy bank.\r\n\r\nThey were two bright, determined young people, however, and through their unremitting efforts they were able to acquire once again the knowledge and feeling that qualified them to return as full-fledged members of society. Heaven be praised, they became truly upstanding citizens who knew how to transfer from one subway line to another, who were fully capable of sending a special-delivery letter at the post office. Indeed, they even experienced love again, sometimes as much as 75% or even 85% love.\r\n\r\nTime passed with shocking swiftness, and soon the boy was thirty-two, the girl thirty.\r\n\r\nOne beautiful April morning, in search of a cup of coffee to start the day, the boy was walking from west to east, while the girl, intending to send a special-delivery letter, was walking from east to west, but along the same narrow street in the Harajuku neighborhood of Tokyo. They passed each other in the very center of the street. The faintest gleam of their lost memories glimmered for the briefest moment in their hearts. Each felt a rumbling in their chest. And they knew:\r\n\r\nShe is the 100% perfect girl for me.\r\n\r\nHe is the 100% perfect boy for me.\r\n\r\nBut the glow of their memories was far too weak, and their thoughts no longer had the clarity of fourteen years earlier. Without a word, they passed each other, disappearing into the crowd. Forever.\r\n\r\nA sad story, don\'t you think?\r\n\r\nYes, that\'s it, that is what I should have said to her.','I saw the perfect girl one April morning','','publish','open','open','','i-saw-the-perfect-girl-one-april-morning','','','2010-10-29 22:55:00','2010-10-29 22:55:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=525',0,'post','',0),(526,2,'2010-11-22 03:28:00','2010-11-22 03:28:00','What the fuck...please don\'t talk to me right now; I\'m drunk.','','','private','open','open','','526','','','2010-11-22 03:28:00','2010-11-22 03:28:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=526',0,'post','',0),(527,2,'2010-11-23 00:48:00','2010-11-23 00:48:00','I am so embarrassed.','','','publish','open','open','','527','','','2010-11-23 00:48:00','2010-11-23 00:48:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=527',0,'post','',0),(528,2,'2010-11-29 22:26:00','2010-11-29 22:26:00','Respect for the young is no less important than respect for women, other races, the elderly, or authority. Fools put them down and underestimate their abilities, but I hope I never forget that. I\'m taking note so that one day I can look back and remember in case I ever lose sight of this. It\'s one of my biggest fears; that one day I will grow old, treat the young as inferior, lose touch of their perspective, their difficulties, tell them I know more than they do, that I am wiser than they are. Others do it. My parents did it. I pray that I won\'t. I pray that I will never forget how hard it was to be young. But I feel myself forgetting already, and I\'ve just barely left. I haven\'t yet lost it, but I find myself forgetting what I thought I could try and remember. I remember it was there and I remember how it felt, but I can\'t remember exactly what it was. I think it\'s inevitable. Soon I will grow old and will think, &quot;Surely, I remembered what life was like when I was young, but since then I have forgotten and still do not know how to deal with it from my older self.&quot; <br /><br />That\'s where I wish I would have taken note to future self in greater detail. That\'s not to say that I didn\'t--I made countless notes to my future self, promising I would always do this and never do that when I grew older, but they were all internally stored and contextually inspired. When I vented to myself, creating long monologues and internally expressing my frustrations, my frustrations would be momentarily satisfied and the thoughts pushed aside. They still existed of course, but they weren\'t going anywhere; I surely was not forgetting them. But as time slowly moves on, all thoughts are forgotten and life continues. I now am now out of touch with the struggles of my younger days and thankful for where I am. And I expect that gratitude to do nothing but increase as my days increase as well. <br /><br />But there are some things I will never forget, no matter how out of touch I am with my adolescence. Respect the young, for their dreams are big and their hope is wide. Their confidence is not yet developed, and they are not yet in control of their life. Their happiness and well-being are in the hands of others, leaving them helpless to their emotions. Life gets easier as time moves on; adolescence is the most difficult stage of life. They are much more competent than you imagine, no matter how many mistakes they make or how wrong they are in certain situations. They know exactly how to obey and do it everyday, they just haven\'t yet figured out if they want that to be themselves or someone else--and rightly so. They are always told what to do: show them mercy. Be quick to teach, willing to help, slow to anger, and hesitant to judge. Their level of knowledge and experience is lesser than yours, but that makes them no less competent than you. <br /><em><br />Don&rsquo;t let anyone think less of you because you are young. Be an example to all believers in what you say, in the way you live, in your love, your faith, and your purity. <br /><br />You who are young, make the most of your youth. Relish your youthful vigor. Follow the impulses of your heart. If something looks good to you, pursue it. But know also that not just anything goes; you have to answer to God for every last bit of it. </em>','the young.','','publish','open','open','','the-young','','','2010-11-29 22:26:00','2010-11-29 22:26:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=528',0,'post','',0),(529,2,'2011-01-10 01:57:00','2011-01-10 01:57:00','why is there no girl for me anywhere?','','','publish','open','open','pickle','529','','','2011-01-10 01:57:00','2011-01-10 01:57:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=529',0,'post','',0),(530,2,'2011-01-10 03:16:00','2011-01-10 03:16:00','wanted: single f\r\n under 33\r\n must enjoy the sun\r\n must enjoy the sea\r\n sought by single m\r\n mrs destiny\r\n send photo to address\r\n is it you and me?\r\n \r\n reply to single m:\r\n my name is caroline\r\n cell phone number here\r\n call if you have the time\r\n 28 and bored\r\n grieving over loss\r\n sorry to be heavy\r\n but heavy is the cost\r\n heavy is the cost\r\n \r\n reply to caroline:\r\n thanks so much for response\r\n these things can be scary\r\n not always what you want\r\n how about a drink?\r\n this ancient club at noon\r\n i\'ll phone you first i guess\r\n i hope i see you soon\r\n \r\n i never got your name\r\n i assume you\'re 33\r\n your voice it sounded kind\r\n i hope that you like me\r\n when you see my face\r\n i hope that you don\'t laugh\r\n i\'m not a film star beauty\r\n i\'ll send a photograph\r\n i hope that you don\'t laugh\r\n \r\n note to single m:\r\n why did you not show up?\r\n i waited for an hour\r\n i finally gave up\r\n i thought once that i saw you\r\n i thought that you saw me\r\n i guess we\'ll never meet now\r\n it wasn\'t meant to be\r\n it wasn\'t mean to be\r\n i was sure you saw me\r\n but it wasn\'t meant to be','Personal','','publish','open','open','','personal','','','2011-01-10 03:16:00','2011-01-10 03:16:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=530',0,'post','',0),(531,2,'2011-01-21 02:09:00','2011-01-21 02:09:00','Once my heart was filled with the love of a girl.

She was just another freshman in my Spanish class. I was with all the cool kids, and she was just another in a sea of people I didn\'t know. I&nbsp;noticed her, thought she was cute with her short hair, but nothing ever went past that. She was probably more outgoing then. I think I would have enjoyed knowing her if I&nbsp;had actually gotten to be around her more than I actually did: just another girl in class that I didn\'t know. She probably knew my name. I\'m sure I knew her\'s eventually, but that\'s all that it was. <br /><br />Fast forward way ahead. It\'s been too long to remember the details, but she got with my brother. I&nbsp;don\'t remember what happened in between, but it eventually happened, and I still knew her as that one girl I had watched in class from time to time. I&nbsp;took pride in claiming that I&nbsp;knew her first and that she was still my friend. She still had short hair and hung out with my brother all the time. When they got more serious, she eventually spent more time with the family since she was constantly with my brother, and thus we got to know her better. <br /><br />She wasn\'t really what I expected. Our personalities clashed a little bit. She was too sensitive and I was and still am very blunt and straight-forward, and the two don\'t always mix very well. My strong will and confidence at times overshadowed her sensitivity and insecurity more and more as time went on. Until one day: things changed.<br /><br />My brother decided that it wasn\'t for him anymore. I don\'t blame him, and I think he made the right choice, but she wasn\'t okay with it. She was in the middle of a relationship that she was perfectly okay with, and he was done. I\'m not sure what his reasoning was, but I think she was moving deeper and deeper and getting more serious, while he was just living his life and being himself, not unlike most all other boys his age. Before long, he left for a summer program that took him far away and left him with little reason to contact anyone back home, as he had plenty of new friends to make and not much motivation to worry about what he had left behind. It served as a separation point for him--one that pushed him to move onward and forget about what was in the past.<br /><br />But where did that leave her? She had a great need that still needed to be filled, but would no longer be filled by my brother. I\'m sure from there came many depressed and excruciating nights. But she had to soon adjust and fill that void with something. I\'m sure she tried many things. I\'m sure her girlfriends helped some. The timeline is fuzzy since it\'s been so many years, but regardless, time passed. Time passed and she tried to fill her emptiness with many things. I\'m not sure how long before it was that she came to me, but eventually she did.<br /><br />Woah. Rewind. Here\'s where my memory starts to fail on me. I remember now. She was still with my brother when he left for his Summer program. It would be hard for them to be apart for so long during the Summer, but there wasn\'t anything they could do about it, so they would have to deal with it. My brother was off having a good time and she was back at home, feeling rather alone. She needed compensation for her loneliness, so she turned to her friends. One of those people included me. I wasn\'t my brother, but I was similar. I am very different from him, but have many of the same characteristics and have a few things in common in which we are very similar to each other. She needed someone to talk to and often came to me to satisfy that. I didn\'t mind. I&nbsp;didn\'t necessarily want to talk to her all the time, but I didn\'t mind. <br /><br />Here\'s where it started to become more obvious as to how different we were. Things I&nbsp;said often got on her nerves, as I\'m much more honest and straight-forward than my brother is, and it annoyed me that she took offense to that trait at some times. But anyway, I&nbsp;knew that she needed someone to talk to, so I didn\'t mind it. She was no longer a &quot;friend&quot; to me, but only &quot;my brother\'s girlfriend.&quot; I\'m confident that feeling was not mutual. There were a few times that I was uncomfortable with how much she was turning to me to fill the void that my brother was leaving (for he was busy and having a good time with all the new friends he was meeting--many of them girls), but as long as she wasn\'t calling me at night, I was okay with it. Had she not been my brother\'s girlfriend, I would have been fine with it, but she was, and I&nbsp;was not. There was probably a time or two that I&nbsp;said, &quot;Listen. I\'m not my brother. I can\'t be him, and with the situation we\'re in right now, I can\'t fill that void. I&nbsp;can be your friend, I can listen to your problems, and I can give you my perspective on life and my friendship, but in the end, I\'m not him.&quot; She said, &quot;I know, I know,&quot; and understood that I was not okay with her calling me, only to talk. She talked to me in text all the time though, whether by phone or by computer. <br /><br />It may not seem obvious as of yet, but if you can\'t tell, at this point it was very one-sided, and that\'s how it stayed for years. I would never let her know that, though. I&nbsp;had compassion for her and let her use me as a source to get all her feelings and problems and insecurities out. I\'ve always been one to enjoy someone that I can tell wants to talk to me, regardless of whether I&nbsp;want to talk to them or not. Just the fact that they desire to have my attention is enough for me to give it to them, even if I&nbsp;don\'t always want to talk to them--I&nbsp;will entertain it. And she was one of those people. If you remember, we didn\'t have much in common. Our personalities clashed a tiny bit, but I was tolerant of her, and she needed my advice and my support, so I always gave it to her, no matter what. After a few months, my brother came home and school started again. I think the Summer had made my brother realize what he wanted and what he didn\'t want, and that\'s when he decided to leave her behind. Like I said, I think he made the right decision; that\'s just how things work out sometimes. <br /><br />So with her by herself now, she had built me up to fill the void that my brother had left, and now that he was gone for good, that continued, and at this point, only that much more extreme. The time I spent talking with her was something that I&nbsp;still tolerated, not enjoyed. I&nbsp;don\'t want to sound cold-hearted, but I do want to emphasize that part of the relationship, for it was very defining of the relationship from my perspective. It was, after all, out of my compassion for her, that I gave her so much out of my time to support her. How long this continued, I\'m not sure, but it was for years in total, and by this point I was surely soon to go off to college, if not already. I&nbsp;don\'t know where this puts us on the timeline of our relationship, but I gave her this sort of support for years, even after my brother was out of the picture (yet he was never truly out of the picture for her for a very, very, very long time). And I&nbsp;understood this. I&nbsp;had endured the same sort of relationship unfulfillment and neediness in my day--yet in my case it was something I had to learn to deal with myself, and that\'s something I\'m glad I&nbsp;was able to prove to myself that I&nbsp;was strong enough to do. All the while, I&nbsp;knew how many years it took to truly get over being in love with someone, so my perspective and advice to her was sound and relevant and true. <br /><br />So as the years moved on, I grew to enjoy her attention little by little. It was still one-sided, but I&nbsp;no longer had to force myself to tolerate it as much. I&nbsp;wish I&nbsp;could accurately describe my feelings towards this friendship. It was something that I had to tolerate, but not something I looked forward to or enjoyed. It was almost a chore. But I&nbsp;attended to it at my own will. I&nbsp;guess maybe it was something I felt obligated to do. If you know me, then you know I do nothing that I&nbsp;don\'t want to do. So it wasn\'t that I&nbsp;didn\'t want to talk to her and support her--but I&nbsp;guess it was, like I said, that I wanted to because I&nbsp;felt that I had to, because I needed to, because I felt that it was the right thing to give her my attention. As the years went on, I still did it it because it was the right thing to do, but more and more because it was what I&nbsp;had always done. Much later, but eventually, it was less because I had to, and more because I&nbsp;wanted to.<br /><br />As I moved in to college and the months went by, I&nbsp;developed insecurities of my own. I&nbsp;still had the full amount of confidence I needed to deal with them myself, but on the very rare occasion, I did share a thing or two with her possibly. Yet, do not misunderstand. The relationship still continued with the one-sidedness that it always had, but by this time, I was much more comfortable with her confiding in me now that my brother was far out of the picture, mostly. <br /><br />Farther into college, I gained confidence in some areas and developed more insecurities in other areas, but the relationship stayed the same. As the years had gone by, I had become more comfortable with where we were and felt that it was less of a chore to deal with her in my life. By sophomore year, I helped her deal with moving away from home and making new friends at her own school. I&nbsp;helped her move into her freshman dorm. Before long, an attraction developed, and I didn\'t mind talking to her. Yet it was faint. Very faint. Since she had been with my brother, it was never something that I&nbsp;allowed, so this attraction never really developed, and certainly never went anywhere. But it now meant that I&nbsp;didn\'t mind spending time with her or talking to her because my brother was so far in the past that it was okay. Months went by and I began to grow my own need in the relationship for the first time ever. At this time, it had been more than 4 years since we had met. (And that\'s not to say 1 year of knowing her, 2 years of acquaintance, and 1 year of friendship, as some relationships go--it was 4 years of truly knowing and getting to know her.) So for the first time in so many years, I finally had my own need. A very simple need. All I wanted was affection. It wasn\'t involved. It wasn\'t inappropriate. It wasn\'t hard to ask for. It was simple. And I&nbsp;don\'t mean anything sexual, I&nbsp;just wanted to feel that I&nbsp;was someone special and that someone cared for me because it was something that I&nbsp;couldn\'t get from anyone else. I tried to communicate it to her, and she seemed to respond well to it, but she would deny it in the end. I&nbsp;always knew that I&nbsp;would never develop a relationship with her because it socially would be too awkward or unacceptable after being with my brother and even without those aspects, we didn\'t have enough in common anyway. Our personalities didn\'t match and I just wasn\'t attracted to her in the end anyway. Yet I still wanted the affection of a friend. I&nbsp;wanted the touch of a friend that would let me know I&nbsp;meant something to her. And this was after years of her telling me how amazing I was to her, and how influential I was in her life and how thankful she was for all the wisdom I had provided to her and how she didn\'t know where she would be in her life without me. So after years of giving and giving and giving, this was the one simple thing that I wanted. She wouldn\'t give it to me, but in the end, it didn\'t matter. I didn\'t hold it against her. I&nbsp;felt very frustrated with how much I&nbsp;put into the relationship and how much I&nbsp;got out of it (which was mostly nothing), but in the end, I got over it and moved on. Though I was annoyed, I&nbsp;didn\'t hold a grudge. I&nbsp;really didn\'t care. She surely wanted the affection from me as well, and admitted to it, but for some reason wouldn\'t give in--maybe for the same reasons that I&nbsp;was uncomfortable with it previously. I had bigger worries in my life than whether I&nbsp;felt loved or not, so I focused on those, such as my schooling. And don\'t forget that I&nbsp;had plenty of other people in my life. She was only a very small part of it. I&nbsp;had plenty of other friends to go to, so it didn\'t really matter.<br /><br />So now we are at the point where I finally see her as a friend. She\'s no longer someone I help out because I feel it\'s the right thing to do, but someone I don\'t mind talking to and don\'t mind spending time with. And for the first time in all these years, she no longer needs me. She can finally cope on her own: much of that having to do with the fact that she has now developed relationships at her own school that support her and help her to be who she wants to be. So for the first time in years, I&nbsp;no longer have to be there for her all the time. She has others who are there for her. She has others that can be positive role models in her life. And of course, because of this, I no longer talked to her as much. And it continued like this for about a year or so. <br /><br />So as life went on, I&nbsp;talked to her and spent time with her as a friend for the first time, not as I had in the past as someone I&nbsp;was mentoring and guiding through life. Yet after this &quot;year or so,&quot; that brings us almost to date. We had gone through a lot in the past, and she always voiced her respect for me and her concern for my life. She always asked me about my personal matters and how things went with girls and I&nbsp;would always tell her. She would always worry about me, whether it was this or that, saying that she never wanted me to get hurt. And all this was okay with me. She was a friend. She had come to visit me in the city a few times, and I&nbsp;had gone to visit her in her town once or twice, but never really out of my own time I finally felt that I should devote some of my own time to going out to visit her. At this point, I had known her closely for more than 6 years and thought I&nbsp;should finally put some effort into it. So I&nbsp;did. I&nbsp;devoted a weekend to go visit her and have a good time. I&nbsp;asked her room mate to find us something to do, and we convinced her to come along. I&nbsp;had been 21 for months now, so I brought a few drinks. She was annoyed with it, but I&nbsp;shrugged it off and told her to get over it in some way or another. Obviously I was doing nothing wrong. Yet as the night went on, she became very angry. She was being extremely rude to me, insulting me, calling me drunk, and in general, having no respect for my choices. And I certainly was not drunk. Yet with every move I made, she became more insulting and rude to me. So after so many years of unending support, open-mindedness, so many years of listening to her and not judging her for a single choice she had made, in less than a few hours, she took everything I stood for, my judgment, my choices, and completely insulted them. It\'s difficult to describe how that affected me or why I took offense to it, but I rarely take offense to anything, so I&nbsp;didn\'t feel that my emotions needed to be justified--although I feel that they were anyway. I&nbsp;was so upset at the time, I can\'t even remember it perfectly clearly. I&nbsp;had never gotten upset with her--not even once. I&nbsp;was endlessly supportive and asked for nothing in return for so many years. And in one night, she took everything we had and told me with her actions that it meant nothing to her. I was nothing but a tool she had used when she needed me. This describes perfectly how I feel about her right now and how I had felt about her in the past when she had refused me any sort of affection--that I was nothing but a tool to use when she needed me and discard me when she was done with me. She didn\'t care any of my needs--not that I ever asked for anything. The year before she denied my affection, and this year told me that she had no respect for me and no respect for the way I live my life.<br /><br />I&nbsp;was a fool for ever giving you my unconditional support, and I&nbsp;was a fool for continuing to give it to you for so long. I&nbsp;cannot figure out why I&nbsp;did it. Even sitting here trying to write it down, I cannot explain it, cannot figure it out on my own. I&nbsp;have always been the better person, and here tonight, looking back upon so many years of memories, I have still come to be the better person. My mind will remain open, my heart forgiving, my actions compassionate, my loyalty true, and my path undeviating. I have long forgiven you for the way you\'ve treated me, but will not allow you to return to the way things were before. If you want them to be, then you\'ll have to fix them yourself. I\'ve given you years of respect and support, and I\'m tired of taking the back-end. I&nbsp;have lost a friend in you, only to find that I never really had a friend in you.

I used to be humble about it back in the day; I would reassure myself that I didn\'t know what true love was, that I was only an adolescent and that one day I would know a more intense version of what I felt. A duller emotion rather than a sharp, short-term one. I was wrong about that though. I definitely knew what love was. I didn\'t know all the intricacies of it; I didn\'t know how to live it out; I didn\'t know perfectly how to treat those that I felt this way about, but I certainly knew what love was. I think it was shallow to think I didn\'t know what love was.\r\n\r\nAnd honestly, subconsciously I knew that I knew. But on the outside of the inside I told myself I didn\'t quite know yet, just to be sure. Because everyone seemed to be so adamant that teenagers don\'t know what love is. No, they only know of infatuation. But this is wrong. There are plenty of teens out there who don\'t understand, but I certainly did. And to not listen to my own heart was only holding me back.\r\n\r\nWhen I truly loved and lost, I never doubted it again. And it took me years to get over. I struggled with getting over that love for much longer than it had lasted.

People may push their own perspectives on you, and you should listen to them, but don\'t take their word over yours unless you meditate on that perspective and take it as your own. You are in control of your own life. Not mathematics. And deep down inside, you may doubt it, but you know what love is.

I\'m wearing really cute panties today - all pink and frilly and lacy.&quot; \r\n&quot;That just makes it worse,&quot; I said with a sigh. I went back to my room and washed and shaved as fast as I could, put on a blue button-down shirt and a grey tweed sports coat, then went back down and ushered Midori out through the dorm gate. I was in a cold sweat. \r\n&quot;Tell me, Watanabe,&quot; Midori said, looking up at the dorm buildings, &quot;do all the guys in here wank--rub-a-dub-dub?&quot; \r\n&quot;Probably,&quot; I said. \r\n&quot;Do guys think about girls when they do that?&quot; \r\n&quot;I suppose so. I kind of doubt that anyone thinks about the stock market or verb conjugations or the Suez Canal when they wank. Nope, I\'m pretty sure just about everybody thinks about girls.&quot; \r\n&quot;The Suez Canal?&quot; \r\n&quot;For example.&quot; \r\n&quot;So I suppose they think about particular girls, right?&quot; \r\n&quot;Shouldn\'t you be asking your boyfriend about that?&quot; I said. &quot;Why should I have to explain stuff like this to you on a Sunday morning?&quot;\r\n&quot;I was just curious,&quot; she said. &quot;Besides, he\'d get angry if I asked him about stuff like that. He\'d say girls aren\'t supposed to ask all those questions.&quot; \r\n&quot;A perfectly normal point of view, I\'d say.&quot;\r\n&quot;But I want to know. This is pure curiosity. Do guys think about particular girls when they wank?&quot; I gave up trying to avoid the question. \r\n&quot;Well, I do at least. I don\'t know about anybody else.&quot;\r\n&quot;Have you ever thought about me while you were doing it? Tell me the truth. I won\'t be angry.&quot; \r\n&quot;No, I haven\'t, to tell the truth,&quot; I answered honestly. \r\n&quot;Why not? Aren\'t I attractive enough?&quot; \r\n&quot;Oh, you\'re attractive, all right. You\'re cute, and sexy outfits look great on you.&quot; \r\n&quot;So why don\'t you think about me?&quot; \r\n&quot;Well, first of all, I think of you as a friend, so I don\'t want to involve you in my sexual fantasies, and second--&quot; \r\n&quot;You\'ve got somebody else you\'re supposed to be thinking about.&quot; \r\n&quot;That\'s about the size of it,&quot; I said. \r\n&quot;You have good manners even when it comes to something like this,&quot; Midori said. &quot;That\'s what I like about you. Still, couldn\'t you allow me just one brief appearance? I want to be in one of your sexual fantasies or daydreams or whatever you call them. I\'m asking you because we\'re friends. Who else can I ask for something like that? I can\'t just walk up to anyone and say, \'When you wank tonight, will you please think of me for a second?\' It\'s because I think of you as a friend that I\'m asking. And I want you to tell me later what it was like. You know, what you did and stuff.&quot; I let out a sigh. &quot;You can\'t put it in, though. Because we\'re just friends. Right? As long as you don\'t put it in, you can do anything you like, think anything you want.&quot;\r\n&quot;I don\'t know, I\'ve never done it with so many restrictions before,&quot; I said. \r\n&quot;Will you just think about me?&quot; \r\n&quot;All right, I\'ll think about you.&quot;\r\n&quot;You know, Watanabe, I don\'t want you to get the wrong impression - that I\'m a nymphomaniac or frustrated or a tease or anything. I\'m just interested in that stuff. I want to know about it. I grew up surrounded by nothing but girls in a girls\' school, you know that. I want to find out what guys are thinking and how their bodies are put together. And not just from pull-out sections in the women\'s magazines but actual case studies.&quot;\r\n&quot;Case studies?&quot; I groaned. \r\n&quot;But my boyfriend doesn\'t like it when I want to know things or try things. He gets angry, calls me a nympho or crazy. He won\'t even let me give him a blow job. Now, that\'s one thing I\'m dying to study.&quot; \r\n&quot;Uh-huh.&quot; \r\n&quot;Do you hate getting blow jobs?&quot; \r\n&quot;No, not really, I don\'t hate it.&quot; \r\n&quot;Would you say you like it?&quot; \r\n&quot;Yeah, I\'d say that. But can we talk about this next time? Here it is, a really nice Sunday morning, and I don\'t want to ruin it talking about wanking and blow jobs. Let\'s talk about something else. Is your boyfriend at the same university as us?&quot; \r\n&quot;Nope, he goes to another one, of course. We met at school during a club activity. I was in the girls\' school, he was in the boys\', and you know how they do those things, joint concerts and stuff. We got serious after our exams, though. Hey, Watanabe.&quot; \r\n&quot;What?&quot; \r\n&quot;You only have to do it once. Just think about me, OK?&quot; \r\n&quot;OK, I\'ll give it a try, next time,&quot; I said, throwing in the towel.','','','publish','open','open','','545','','','2011-03-15 03:03:00','2011-03-15 03:03:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=545',0,'post','',0),(546,2,'2011-03-17 01:38:00','2011-03-17 01:38:00','So, you really think I\'m that insensitive do you? Maybe one day you\'ll learn to respect your friends more than your values. And one day, I\'ll lose my respect for my <i>friends</i>&nbsp;with values--yet I\'ve mostly already done that. Here\'s a value for you: close-mindedness. I doubt anyone\'s told you, but that\'s the one you have the most of. Oh, you see it as something different, awareness, commitment, courage, strong will, resilience. Well it\'s not. You\'re a close-minded fool.&nbsp;<br /><br />Do you really think you can change the world? You can\'t. We are so exceptionally insignificant. A human is nothing. A human can do nothing. All I can do is live. I have no hope to change the world, no desire to change the world--because I cannot. If you think you can, you will slowly realize disappointment. Humans as a whole certainly can change the world. Humans as a whole can do absolutely anything, absolutely breathtakingly powerful things. But you can only control yourself. And that singular will, no matter how strong, will never have the strength to do anything significant, much less powerful.<br /><br />You are such a fraud. Why don\'t you stop trying to change the world and focus on those around you? Focus on those who are important in your life. Give something back to those who give to you. Stop being so insensitive. I used to hate what you were. I wanted you to stop crying all the time, relax a little, and stiffen up.&nbsp;But since you\'ve changed, I hate what you have become even more. Now you\'re nothing but an insensitive rod. And you\'re too busy accusing me of being insensitive to see your own blinding insensitivity.&nbsp;<br /><br />You are so humble that you are arrogant. You are so accepting that you are disrespectful. You are so aware that you are blind. You are so caring that you do not care. You support justice so much that you cannot even see the injustice in your own motivations. You are close-minded. I\'m so thankful for everything I have become and exactly who God has made me. And I\'m so glad that I never had to rely on you for anything. For instead of being disappointed, I merely scoff at your arrogance. You live in your own little world.&nbsp;<br /><br /><i>I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.</i><br /><br />It\'s amazing how such a small thought can lead to so many other conclusions.<br /><br /><i>&ldquo;I can sympathize with everything, except suffering,&rdquo; said Lord Henry, shrugging his shoulders. &ldquo;I cannot sympathize with that.

Not that I&nbsp;have changed how I&nbsp;feel about that, but rather I&nbsp;might have grown indifferent. He gives young males such strong sexual urges, yet doesn\'t put them into a position to healthily satisfy them until much later in life. If they follow his advice for their lives, they either struggle with this load for years until they\'re wise enough to understand enough about themselves to find someone special to them, or they make many mistakes that hurt themselves and others. It doesn\'t make sense. And these are the reasons why people take drastic measures that they often can\'t control that lead to things like rape or abuse. Is there no better solution? Why can\'t you just make males and females equally?\r\n\r\nAnd I think it\'s this partial lifelong struggle that gives them a respectful sexual relationship towards their love. Yet it\'s this lifelong struggle that takes the newness and excitement out of these feelings. Many will argue that it &quot;only makes it that much more special,&quot; but speaking from experience, it\'s full of shit. It does nothing but cheapens the experience. Because of it, I have a bitter attitude towards it, a cynical attitude; I don\'t give it any respect. \r\n\r\n I\'m so sick of the attitude that sex is the most sacred thing in the world. Maybe it is. Sure. Whatever. I\'m not saying it\'s not, just shut up about it. Nobody cares. Be real for a second. Stop living in your fairytale Godworld. \r\n\r\nAnd the worst part is that I know I will forget my struggles. I&nbsp;will move on with a married life one day with someone I love so much that I will forget anything I\'d ever even been frustrated with at all. And I&nbsp;knew this even as a young one. I\'m not regretting anything that I\'ve done--doing what I believed is right or fighting sexual urges rather than finding an outlet for them, but it pisses me off to no end that this is how I&nbsp;was made, and even more so that I won\'t be able to hold on to and remember these struggles as I grow older.','design flaw','','publish','open','open','','design-flaw','','','2011-04-18 20:30:00','2011-04-18 20:30:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=547',0,'post','',18),(548,2,'2011-04-19 13:06:00','2011-04-19 13:06:00','<em>I think if you don\'t really like a girl, you shouldn\'t horse around with  her at all, and if you do like her, then you\'re supposed to like her  face, and if you like her face, you ought to be careful about doing  crumby stuff to it, like squirting water all over it.

Now that I\'ve finally found someone that makes me happy, I don\'t know what to do. What do I&nbsp;complain about? What feelings to I have to express? I don\'t have to VENT&nbsp;my happiness! That\'s what my journal is for! VENTING! When I have nothing to vent about, what do I&nbsp;do??

The girl I am in love with wants nothing to hear about it (she is too cautious of love for fear of being hurt--and I, of course, do not blame her by any means), but I have never been more sure of anything in my life. There have been so many moments in my life in which people have told me I don\'t know what I\'m talking about or I\'m too naive or I\'m too young to know about this or that, but in every single situation those people have been wrong. I\'ve looked back to every situation my parents fought with me and have joyed myself in knowing they were so fucking wrong. I\'ve always been right. That\'s just how it\'s been. No one knows myself better than myself. They\'ve tried to tell me I\'ve been wrong for so many years, and I\'m so glad I never gave a shit about what they said. I\'m so thankful for my confidence. I\'m sick of people not giving me the respect I&nbsp;deserve, and I\'m glad that part of my life is over. Fuck you for taking advantage of me. Fuck you for not giving me the respect I deserve. I&nbsp;will struggle to forgive you until the day I&nbsp;die--or until the day I forget about it.\r\n\r\nAnd I am so in love with this girl. I have been waiting for her all of my life.

at least on her end?<br /><br />[5/20/11 12:04:54 AM] Russell Strauss: they\'re not issues that matter, such as how well we get along, how our personalities fit together, etc.<br />[5/20/11 12:05:08 AM] Russell Strauss: but she\'s not superficial at all<br />[5/20/11 12:05:37 AM] Russell Strauss: she just is too young to realize that she\'s doing that. it\'s justified in her mind<br />[5/20/11 12:06:16 AM] Russell Strauss: which I understand, but she doesn\'t yet understand relationships to know<br /><br />[5/20/11 12:06:38 AM] Jane Howard: so maybe she has some growing up to do before things could really work out. that\'s something I\'ve learned fa sho. like I always want to grow with people, but it doesn\'t work. you have to figure it out on your own a little bit first, know what I\'m sayin?<br /><br />[5/20/11 12:10:07 AM] Russell Strauss: well<br />[5/20/11 12:10:31 AM] Russell Strauss: I mean I don\'t understand why she doesn\'t want to be with me because of that<br />[5/20/11 12:10:43 AM] Russell Strauss: like I have tons to teach her just about life in general<br />[5/20/11 12:11:14 AM] Russell Strauss: I\'m just going to become another guy to her<br />[5/20/11 12:11:18 AM] Russell Strauss: and that\'s so unfair<br />[5/20/11 12:13:28 AM] Russell Strauss: let me show you something that she posted about me that I found a few weeks ago<br /><br />[5/20/11 12:14:29 AM] Jane Howard: I know, I really do. earlier this year, I was kind of heading in a relationship direction with this guy, and then he basically shut me down. and it was a whole thing of how we would be growing together, not like on our own, and that wasn\'t a good thing. and I thought that was really dumb, and he was totally wrong. and I\'m kind of a stubborn person sometimes, but he was totally right. like I totally felt like I had a ton to learn from him, and vice versa. but I\'m so glad that it played out that way, it wouldn\'t have worked out then if we had been in a relationship, but now I\'m definitely more prepared for a relationship and blah blah blah. and he\'s still really important in my life, and I am in his. so you won\'t just become another guy<br />[5/20/11 12:14:41 AM] Jane Howard: sorry if that was long and you don\'t really care, but it reminds me of your situation<br /><br />[5/20/11 12:18:08 AM] Russell Strauss: why wouldn\'t I care?<br />[5/20/11 12:18:15 AM] Russell Strauss: but see that\'s the thing<br />[5/20/11 12:18:24 AM] Russell Strauss: what you\'re saying is totally true<br />[5/20/11 12:18:28 AM] Russell Strauss: and I know it<br />[5/20/11 12:18:37 AM] Russell Strauss: I know it because I\'ve been there.<br /><br />[5/20/11 12:18:58 AM] Jane Howard: haha I don\'t mean it like that, I just meant that it was long and might not sound as relevant as it did in my head<br /><br />[5/20/11 12:19:16 AM] Russell Strauss: I\'m very careful about making blind claims because I\'m too interested in someone to see obvious flaws in the relationship<br />[5/20/11 12:19:49 AM] Russell Strauss: but I\'ve been so careful up to this point that I\'ve been there so many times<br />[5/20/11 12:20:02 AM] Russell Strauss: and this was finally the time that I didn\'t have any of those problems<br />[5/20/11 12:20:08 AM] Russell Strauss: and she still rejected me<br />[5/20/11 12:20:15 AM] Russell Strauss: and that\'s why I\'m so upset about it<br />[5/20/11 12:21:22 AM] Russell Strauss: There was something that she posted less than a month ago. It was &quot;10 things you\'d want to say to people close to you&quot;<br />[5/20/11 12:21:26 AM] Russell Strauss: and the first one was about me<br />[5/20/11 12:21:34 AM] Russell Strauss: it doesn\'t say my name, but it\'s about me<br />[5/20/11 12:21:38 AM] Russell Strauss: and it said<br />[5/20/11 12:21:39 AM] Russell Strauss: &quot;I have no clue where I would be without you now. Our relationship couldn&rsquo;t have come at a better time. You&rsquo;re the full package and are such a blessing. I can&rsquo;t wait to get to know you even more. (I can&rsquo;t wait to live 5 minutes away from you :D :D :D)&quot;<br />[5/20/11 12:22:15 AM] Russell Strauss: And I don\'t understand why she would say &quot;it couldn\'t have come at a better time&quot; and then break up with me because of the timing<br /><br />[5/20/11 12:23:23 AM] Jane Howard: man russell I\'m really sorry<br />[5/20/11 12:24:09 AM] Jane Howard: honestly though, it could really be for the best. she has a ton of growing to do. think of how much (I\'m guessing) you changed even within your first semester of college<br /><br />[5/20/11 12:25:12 AM] Russell Strauss: well I haven\'t really changed all that much.<br />[5/20/11 12:25:19 AM] Russell Strauss: I\'m definitely in a different place though.<br /><br />[5/20/11 12:25:25 AM] Jane Howard: yeah that\'s what I mean<br /><br />[5/20/11 12:25:31 AM] Russell Strauss: I\'ve changed internally<br /><br />[5/20/11 12:25:33 AM] Jane Howard: like you learned a lot about yourself and alla dat<br /><br />[5/20/11 12:25:53 AM] Russell Strauss: right. but I don\'t think it has affected my relationships though<br />[5/20/11 12:26:05 AM] Russell Strauss: I think she will change a lot<br />[5/20/11 12:26:17 AM] Russell Strauss: that being said though, she is extremely mature<br />[5/20/11 12:26:39 AM] Russell Strauss: it\'s just so frustrating that something so good lasted for so short<br />[5/20/11 12:27:01 AM] Russell Strauss: I know everything happens for a reason, but I\'m so sick of telling myself that.<br />[5/20/11 12:27:27 AM] Russell Strauss: it\'s not like this is just one thing getting me down for a short period. I\'m just sick of being alone for years.<br /><br />[5/20/11 12:29:20 AM] Jane Howard: yeah, I feel ya. I mean I\'ve never been in a relationship, so I know what you mean about being alone. but I\'ve learned a lot how valuable my friendships are, regardless of whether or not I\'m with someone<br />[5/20/11 12:30:15 AM] Jane Howard: and the whole &quot;everything happens for a reason&quot; thing, it sucks to tell yourself that for sure. but seriously, it\'s so true. that\'s the story of my life, crappy situations that I let get me down. but looking back, I\'m so glad they\'ve happened<br /><br />[5/20/11 12:31:02 AM] Russell Strauss: I know<br />[5/20/11 12:31:05 AM] Russell Strauss: and that\'s what I do<br />[5/20/11 12:31:21 AM] Russell Strauss: but it gets to a certain point when that\'s all there is<br />[5/20/11 12:32:05 AM] Russell Strauss: and who cares if it will do you good down the road? if it never pays off then it just goes on and on<br />[5/20/11 12:32:13 AM] Russell Strauss: I\'ve been in a number of serious relationships back in the day, and I figured out what I want and what I need. And when I see something that is exactly what I want and need, it\'s so frustrating to lose it.<br /><br />[5/20/11 12:33:05 AM] Jane Howard: I know. it\'s really hard to see someone who you\'d be really, really awesome with, and then they just put an end to it for no reason. that\'s kinda how I\'m feeling right now<br /><br />[5/20/11 12:33:34 AM] Russell Strauss: this is the only relationship I\'ve ever been in that my actions directly influenced the outcome in a very visible way. and that\'s one of the worst parts<br />[5/20/11 12:34:01 AM] Russell Strauss: because if I could go back and act a different way knowing what I know right now, I know for a fact it would have turned out very differently<br />[5/20/11 12:34:11 AM] Russell Strauss: and I\'ve never experienced anything like that before<br />[5/20/11 12:34:26 AM] Russell Strauss: it\'s kind of rough being able to see that<br /><br />[5/20/11 12:34:59 AM] Jane Howard: yeah, I guess. but I guess it\'s also kind of good that you know that. like for me I have no idea<br /><br />[5/20/11 12:36:07 AM] Russell Strauss: well normally you can never see where anything went wrong. it\'s just a string of actions and feelings back and forth that eventually form the relationship and guide where it ends up going<br />[5/20/11 12:36:52 AM] Russell Strauss: but there are certain ways that I acted and reacted that scared her, and I don\'t know why they did--they shouldn\'t have--but they did.<br /><br />[5/20/11 12:37:20 AM] Jane Howard: so maybe she wasn\'t ready for that?<br /><br />[5/20/11 12:38:05 AM] Russell Strauss: well no<br />[5/20/11 12:38:08 AM] Russell Strauss: and who cares?<br />[5/20/11 12:38:11 AM] Russell Strauss: I can wait<br />[5/20/11 12:38:15 AM] Russell Strauss: but the thing is<br />[5/20/11 12:38:26 AM] Russell Strauss: I know that she\'ll move on and I\'ve lost my chance<br /><br />[5/20/11 12:38:47 AM] Jane Howard: why do you think that? you still have a chance<br /><br />[5/20/11 12:39:15 AM] Russell Strauss: I\'m okay with her not being ready, but I know that once you get past a certain point, you\'ve lost your chance, no matter have good you are together<br />[5/20/11 12:39:32 AM] Russell Strauss: I mean ideally, yes, but practically, not really<br />[5/20/11 12:40:25 AM] Russell Strauss: it\'s the same way that you can be amazing friends with someone as a child, but as life moves on and pushes the two of you away from each other, even though you might get along amazingly, circumstance keeps you from ever being together again as friends<br />[5/20/11 12:41:11 AM] Russell Strauss: It\'s not always about compatibility, but about how things fit together.<br /><br />[5/20/11 12:41:50 AM] Jane Howard: yeah, I guess. but she\'s going to be in atlanta, and that\'ll be awesome. I really think she just needs some time to grow but hope isn\'t necessarily lost. you can still be there for her if that\'s what you want, just in a different way for right now<br /><br />[5/20/11 12:42:24 AM] Russell Strauss: I suppose, but sometimes that\'s too hard on me to handle it.<br />[5/20/11 12:42:50 AM] Russell Strauss: Honestly, I would rather lose contact with her than see her happy with another guy.<br />[5/20/11 12:43:35 AM] Russell Strauss: It\'s just too hard on your emotions.<br /><br />[5/20/11 12:45:15 AM] Jane Howard: yeah, I feel ya<br />[5/20/11 12:45:25 AM] Jane Howard: people can be frustrating<br /><br />[5/20/11 12:45:57 AM] Russell Strauss: You can say that again<br /><br />[5/20/11 12:46:07 AM] Jane Howard: people can be frustrating<br /><br /><br />I loved you.

I will never be able to be anyone but the unique person that I am, following no standards, no styles, no trends.<br /><br />&quot;Russell, I just don&#39;t get you.

I do everything I can to be my own person: I want to be original and when being original is unoriginal, then I throw it to the wind.<br /><br />You taught me that no one who doesn&#39;t accept me for exactly who I am will ever be good enough for me.

My self-defense kicks in. I&nbsp;am much more aware of my own needs, rather than an all-consuming, self-sacrificing, and insatiable need. My emotions are in tune.\r\n\r\nI am aware of them. I can detect them. I&nbsp;can detect my need to have others around. When I&nbsp;do, I&nbsp;am satisfied. When I&nbsp;do not, I&nbsp;despair.\r\n\r\nI can feel a separation forming. When before I was so adamant on being independent, autonomous, and individual, I quickly latched on. The hard part is getting ripped off. And where I had so quickly began to rely and depend, I&nbsp;am beginning to stand taller again. It certainly doesn&#39;t feel better. It certainly doesn&#39;t feel the same. I&nbsp;am not happy as I was before. I am not confident as I was before. But I&nbsp;am accepting my individualism again. Regrettably so, but accepting. I no longer rely on my idea of you.

I should have done it long ago, while it was still fresh in my memory, but the longer I wait, the foggier it will get. Only months later, and it&#39;s already starting to fade. It&#39;s so sad, because they&#39;re some of the most precious memories I&#39;ve ever made in my entire life. I&#39;m so passionately dreading the day when I can&#39;t remember every little single detail of those three weeks of my life--and that is already starting to happen. I would give anything to have every moment perfectly documented out and preserved forever. So I must remember everything I can possibly remember before it fades away.<br /><br />On one Saturday night, 3 weeks before my college graduation--the last semester of my senior year of college, I went to a party at my good friend Lee&#39;s. It was April 14th, 2012. He had these parties often--probably once a month, and my best friend David and I had been frequenting them quite often that semester in particular. They weren&#39;t always packed, and they weren&#39;t always crazy, but sometimes they were, and they were most usually always fun. I got to see the circle of friends that would always be there, so I enjoyed going to see them and have a good time. This one in particular was one of the last. There weren&#39;t that many people there because they had just had one recently, but in the end, it was a solid group of people and everyone ended up having a wonderful time. There had been a girl I had somewhat expressed interest in, and I wanted to take her and show her how much fun my group of friends had when they party, yet I never expected I would meet someone that would completely change my life.&nbsp;<br /><br />I knew most everyone there. I met a couple new faces, and then had gotten acquainted with basically everyone at the party. I had a pretty big reputation among this group of friends, so it typically wasn&#39;t difficult to make friends with everyone there. Although, there were two girls whom I didn&#39;t recognize after I knew everyone, so I just decided to introduce myself.<br /><br />-&quot;Hey, I&#39;m Megan.&quot;&nbsp;<br />-&quot;And I&#39;m Clara.&quot;<br />-&quot;Clara?&quot;<br />-&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />-&quot;Cool, hey.&quot;<br /><br />They&#39;re both very attractive young ladies, and they seemed to be having a very good time, but Clara was absolutely stunning. The longer I looked at her, the more beautiful I realized she was. I didn&#39;t talk to them really, but continued to mingle and have fun. Later in the night, Clara was nearby as I was talking to someone, and she grabbed my glasses and my hat off of me. It was my favorite hat of all time--the Cleveland Indians hat from my little league baseball team that I had from when I was a litte kid. I was&nbsp;desperately&nbsp;terrified of losing it whenever I took it out of the house. I thought about trying to grab it back, I might have even tried, but thought to myself, &quot;Well, I guess I&#39;m not getting that back right away. I&#39;ll get it back later.&quot; I thoroughly enjoyed the attention from her, so I was relaxed about it. I knew it would give me an excuse to talk to her later.&nbsp;<br /><br />Time passed, and I eventually went to the dance floor where I saw her, along with Megan and their friend William, dancing. Megan and William were dancing together. Clara had on the cutest red dress on, and I just couldn&#39;t get over how adorable she was. She was still wearing my hat and glasses. It was funny because she had probably had them on for at least 20 minutes, but I think it was even longer than that. I grabbed them back. She grabbed me and started dancing with me. I will never forget that moment because literally all I could think was, &quot;Is this really happening to me?&quot; That never happened with me. I never got to dance with girls, much less get grabbed by them. We held hands and danced for a long time. Neither of us were very drunk; I was sober enough for it to be self-conscious and awkward feeling, but I was still having a good time. I didn&#39;t ever want it to end. I felt weird about it because I had brought a different girl to the party to try and impress her, but in this moment, I really didn&#39;t care. I didn&#39;t expect it to go anywhere, but I was holding her hands and dancing with her--I never wanted it to end. Before a long time at all, Megan and William decided that it was time to leave. She told me she had to go. I was&nbsp;disappointed&nbsp;that she was leaving so soon, but there was nothing I could really do about it.<br /><br />&quot;Hey! This was fun! Will you find me on Facebook?&quot;&nbsp;She gave me the strangest look of disdain. I didn&#39;t understand it. But without hesitating for even half a second, I corrected myself: &quot;No! No! I&#39;ll find YOU! What&#39;s your last name?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Gilbert.&quot;<br /><br />And then she left. I didn&#39;t really know what to do at this point. I continued to mingle with my friends and have fun, but was sad it had ended so soon. I didn&#39;t know if I would ever even see her again. I might have stayed another hour or two, then I went home. Berenice wasn&#39;t feeling good, but when she felt good enough to go, her, David, and I left to walk home. We got home and I tucked Berenice in and went to sleep in my own bed. All I could think about was Clara. I stayed up so long thinking about her that night. I had even friended her on Facebook before I got in bed. While lying in bed, I decided I would ask for her number the next day, call her up, and immediately ask her out for dinner for the following weekend. It was a Saturday night. I would typically never have the confidence to do something so suddenly, but I guess that&#39;s just the kind of thing love at first sight does to you.&nbsp;I also didn&#39;t have much time before summer came and everyone left. I had no idea if she would be here for the summer.<br /><br />I woke up the next morning and sent her a message:<br /><br /><div>-&quot;CLARA!&quot;</div><div>-&quot;RUSSELL!&quot;</div><div>-&quot;so i guess we are friends now...&quot;</div><div>-&quot;Of course we are! it was destiny.</div><div>clara, I had so much fun dancing with you last night. I want to hang out more.&quot;</div><div>-&quot;ok. done. i love adventures.&quot;</div><div>-&quot;HAHA.</div><div>perfect.</div><div>what&#39;s your phone number?&quot;</div><div>-&quot;478 251 1493</div><div>you are only slightly creepy by the way, but thats ok, because I think you are fun.&quot;</div><div>-&quot;haha what! why am I creepy??&quot;</div><div>-&quot;finding me and asking for my number...</div><div>its ok.&quot;</div><div>-&quot;you don&#39;t make friends with people after you meet them?&quot;</div><div>-&quot;you are probably looking at all my friends and pictures as we speak</div><div>.... hahaha&quot;<br /><br /><div>-&quot;what kind of adventure do you want to go on?&quot;</div><div>-&quot;well i have a feeling you are a pretty adventurous kid, so i am willing to let you make that call.&quot;<br /><br />Her calling me &quot;creepy&quot; robbed me of all the confidence I needed to call her up and ask her out right then and there. I sent her my number and a text or two, but was very conservative about it. Yet, the texts just continued back and forth; I didn&#39;t want to push it too hard. David and I were out shooting for our documentary, and Clara was in studio while we texted back in forth. Later, I got a text that made me terrified.&nbsp;<br /><br />-&quot;I need a break.&quot;<br />I hesitated then responded:<br />-&quot;From me sending you silly pictures?&quot;<br />-&quot;From studio.&quot;<br />My heart leapt, but I was still hesitant. I had only met her the night before. It was around 3 o&#39;clock.&nbsp;<br />-&quot;Did you want to meet up or do something?&quot;<br />-&quot;Sure, I&#39;m going to church with a friend in about 2 hours, but I have a little time to kill before then.&quot;<br /><br />Good news. She&#39;s a Christian. That&#39;s cool. I got excited.&nbsp;I called her to ask what we wanted to do. I told her we didn&#39;t have much time, but I could come pick her up and we could go cruising around for a little bit. After taking care of the camera equipment and taking my project team back to their cars, I left to go meet up with her. She sat in the grass outside of the architecture building waiting. I didn&#39;t really know what we could do, but I wasn&#39;t extremely concerned or nervous. But I was nervous. We started driving and I suggested I could take her to a cool antique store in the Highlands that David and I had found. We went and browsed for a little bit, but it was already time for her to go for church. She was meeting a friend, and we were already a little late. She invited me, and we decided to meet her friend, Michael Chaney, there. It was such a good sign to me. We went, and I felt good vibes from her. Honestly, there wasn&#39;t really a time that I didn&#39;t get good vibes from her from the second I met her, with the exception of her calling me creepy. After getting out, Michael suggested exactly what I was hoping, &quot;Are you guys hungry?&quot; Clara was. They wanted to go to the new dining hall, which I had never gotten to go to since I hadn&#39;t had a meal plan since I had been a freshman and wanted to try out before I graduated. It was the perfect opportunity! As the night went on, we all ate dinner together and sat talking for a long time. We finally walked out the door and sat outside, talking and enjoying the night. It wasn&#39;t until ten o&#39;clock that we decided to go. Michael went back into his apartment at North Ave, and Clara and I walked down Techwood together, in the direction of both my car and her dorm. She had left her bag in my car. She got her bag and we stood there for a couple minutes. I asked her what she was going to do that night. She told me that she had to do laundry, but she hated doing it alone and all of her friends were busy (we had seen them as we walked down Techwood). I wanted to tell her I would come so badly, but I didn&#39;t want to push it too hard. I had only met her last night. And even though I thought she wanted me to, I wanted to play my cards right. We just sat there in silence and looked at each other. She smiled at me with the most charming smile that could drive a guy wild. And it drove me wild. I smiled back. We looked at each other without saying anything. It should have been awkward, but it wasn&#39;t. I felt so natural with her. I said goodbye and left. I was so&nbsp;ecstatic about how glorious the day had been. I met up with her a little bit before 5 o&#39;clock to possibly hang out for an hour and we had spent the entire evening together. I couldn&#39;t stop smiling.&nbsp;<br /><br />She told me later that that moment was her favorite memory of us together: when we just looked at other smiling, not knowing what to do or say. She wanted to ask if I had any homework to do, if I wanted to come up to her room and study together. I would have said yes, but I suppose she was feeling the same way I was. I went home so happy and excited that night. I remember it vividly. I was already crazy about her.<br /><br />And after that, everything blurs together. It was a glorious three weeks, packed with time spent with her, school, graduation, finals, so much going on. I was living absolutely full speed. I&#39;m beginning to forget it all, but I would do anything to keep that from happening. It&#39;s all in my head, but I don&#39;t know how to extract it.<br /><br />The next day, I felt much better. I just couldn&#39;t believe how well things had gone that day. We continued talking, continued texting. We found excuses to hang out. She told me about her &quot;double lofted megabed&quot; and her room. I was curious. She asked me to come study with her. We decided to pick up some beer, and I came over. We spent the evening doing homework together.&nbsp;I had gone over later in the evening, maybe 7 o&#39;clock. She talked the night before about how she didn&#39;t like sleeping alone, that her room was great for slumber parties. We relaxed, enjoyed each other&#39;s company, and got to know each other.&nbsp;It was a lucky night for me in that I didn&#39;t have that much work to do. I drank a lot more than she did.&nbsp;It got dark. It was dim in her room. As we sat in her room alone, she wrote me a message on a sticky note and stuck it to me. She wanted to kiss me. We went back and forth a few times. Then I kissed her. We spent time enjoying the moment, enjoying each other, learning the taste of each other. We thought about how we had met 2 nights earlier. We were lying down, and she got tired. She wanted to go to sleep. We&nbsp;laid&nbsp;in her bed until she fell asleep. I gave myself time to lie there and sober up, then I quietly got out of bed, slipped out the door, and drove home.&nbsp;That was the last night I ever slept alone until I graduated, she left for the summer, and we were forced apart.&nbsp;</div><div><br />We did the same thing the next night, but this time I stayed. There wasn&#39;t really any question that I was going to. It was natural. From that day forward, we spent every second outside of class together. We ate lunch together, we ate dinner together, we spent time together every night, I went to visit her in studio, and I stayed with her every night.&nbsp;</div></div><br />','For my love, wherever I may find her','','private','open','open','','for-my-love-wherever-i-may-find-her','','','2012-06-28 23:21:00','2012-06-28 23:21:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=589',0,'post','',0),(590,2,'2012-07-10 14:13:00','2012-07-10 14:13:00','Russell Strauss: Can I invade your personal life and probe you for advice?\r\nMelissa Jackson: Sure!

Clara and I waited all summer to see each other. I finally got the chance to fly out and visit. I hadn&#39;t seen her for 8 weeks. I booked the flight about 4 weeks before the trip and the wait was killing us. But it finally came. It&#39;s finally come and gone, and that&#39;s weird to me. I was so outrageously anxious all summer long, and now it&#39;s over. But luckily, in the same way, she be back here before long. The end of the summer will come and go just in the same way. And that&#39;s what I tell myself. Time goes quickly when you only worry about today. Now that I&#39;m working, time flies by. It&#39;s strange.\r\n\r\nBut the time had finally come...thinking about it, I just can&#39;t get over the fact that it&#39;s over. It&#39;s so weird. It&#39;s like a dream. I guess that&#39;s why I want to preserve it forever right here. The time finally came and I made my journey to the airport. I was so excited. I couldn&#39;t contain myself. Many, many longs weeks, days, hours, and minutes of wait, but I finally landed in Minnesota. I walked outside, I was power walking, almost running, and looked for Clara. I didn&#39;t see her anywhere. It was intensely hot. I called her, but she didn&#39;t answer. I walked around for a minute, and then she called back. She was at baggage claim. I told her I was outside. I started walking inside but suddenly saw her coming up the escalator. I yelled at her to turn around and slammed up against the glass. We looked at each other, grinned ear to ear. I just sat there and she looked at me like, &quot;What are you crazy?? Get in here!!&quot; I sprinted inside and toward her. I tried to hug her, she tried to kiss me. It was awkward and funny. We kissed in the middle of the airport, so happy to be with each other, but we almost too excited to do so. We said hello and excitedly ran out the door. The ride home was lots of &quot;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re here! I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m here!&quot; It was wonderful. We got to enjoy the hour long drive alone and take in what it was like to be together again.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe had planned to go see a movie that night and were both excited about it. Clara was hungry, so she wanted to get home and change so we could go eat. We went by the grocery store on the way to pick up milk and ice cream. We went home changed, and finally left for the nearest movie theatre in a downtown square in a nearby town named Excelsior. We went to an italian restaurant in the square for dinner and had a wonderful, fancy, small, and expensive dinner with a bottle of wine. Before we left, she had said I could pick out her outfit. I told her that she couldn&#39;t just say no to whatever I picked, so I picked something. She looked at me, said &quot;Are you kidding me?&quot; and immediately said know. Because of that, I had been in a pretty bad mood the whole way there, so the wine helped with that and let me let go of it. We sat by the lake and then walked into the movie across the street. It was funny because we sat in the wrong theatre at first and didn&#39;t even realize it until the movei started. It was the tiniest little theatre, with only two movies playing. Our theatre only had five rows. Hilarious. It was a movie called Moonrise Kingdom. We enjoyed the movie then headed home. We were anxious to get on hands on each other, but couldn&#39;t do that at home. I wanted to more than she did. We talked about parking, but she didn&#39;t like the idea. She hadn&#39;t done it since high school. Neither had I. We parked and sat there for a second, but a car drove by, slowly, then slower, then slower, then stopped. So we started up the car and left. She wasn&#39;t willing to try anything else. I was mad.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe went home with my irritation and I sat in her room alone. I told her I wanted to be alone. She said hello to her dad, but then eventually came in. She comforted me. I instantly knew everything was going to be alright. We had been struggling keeping each other happy all summer, but when we were together, all of that was gone. I had been terrified all summer that we would get back together and something would have changed since the previous semester. But it just reaffirmed everything that I had thought. We were both wonderful together, it was just the distance that was giving us so much trouble. Something about being apart just kept us from functioning. Yet, when we were together, all of that was gone. And in this moment, I was so satisfied to know that. So hopeful and optimistic. It was a big moment for me that confirmed that everything would be alright. We went on her porch and ate ice cream. It was a wonderful time. We sat and looked at each other and talked, comfortable. Her mom came in after a while, angry that she was eating after midnight, the night before the tests. We talked about what life was like in Minnesota and how much we missed each other. She cried and we held each other. It was so great to have each other to comfort. Before long, we decided to go to bed because we had to wake up early the next morning to go to the doctor to do some tests for her stomach issues, so we went to bed after that. We didn&#39;t get much sleep. I slept in her room, and she slept in her basement.\r\n\r\nWe woke up at 6:30. I was tired, but I felt alright. Just happy to be with Clara. She had gotten pretty upset earlier in the week when she found out she had to get up and go to the doctor to have some tests done during my visit. We got ready and headed to the hospital. She would have to eat radioactive eggs and get MRI&#39;s as they digested. She said that eggs usually made her feel bad and she didn&#39;t want to feel bad all day during our short time together, which is why she was upset about having to do the tests, along with having to wake up early. It took her a couple of hours, but her mom and I got some breakfast and coffee in the hospital cafe after a little bit. The bagel I ate was amazing. It was untoasted, but still so good. Just about the time we sat down, Clara came out of the tests. She had only been in there thirty or forty-five minutes, but she had to let the food digest before they took more pictures. Her coming out made all the difference. I thought I would have to sit alone with her mom all morning, but we got to stay together for the rest of the morning, mostly. She felt worse and worse the longer we stayed there. She got sick in the bathroom before we left, so I tried to comfort her there and on the way home. When we got home we took a nap in her room since we were both exhausted. I tried to fall asleep and came so frustratingly close, but then couldn&#39;t. The coffee I had was keeping me up. We eventually got up and found a note in the kitchen. The family had gone out to eat for lunch. We got alone time. We went back to bed and enjoyed the alone time. Though, her family came back before we were done and had to finish quickly.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe had decided to go swimming that afternoon in a nearby lake. I wanted to go pick out a bathing suit since I hadn&#39;t owned one in years. We went by Kohl&#39;s and found some really great cheap bathing suits. I even found my favorite Adidas sandals on sale for an amazing price! I was so pumped about all of it. I got two great suits for twelve bucks each and the sandals for only twenty dollars. Super excited we headed off to the beach. Before that though, she took me to a tobacco shop in the nearby downtown area. It was the coolest tobacco shop I&#39;ve ever been in. They had so much pipe tobacco. I found this cool humidor that was cheap, so I decided to buy it. My dad had given me money for the trip and I emptied my entire high school change savings, so I had a little bit of money, which made the weekend so much better. We looked at the pipes. She found one she liked, but decided to wait to get it. As we left, we both could tell she really, really wanted it. It was a nice pipe for a decent price, and she seemed to be picky about them. Before we had gotten to the car, we laughed together and decided to go back and get it. It was so fun.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe went to the beach and had a great time swimming. We just had a beautiful hour together, holding on to each other and enjoy our closeness and undivided attention. She was super into me at the moment. I loved it. We were happy. We got out after a while to lay on the beach before we left. There really isn&#39;t much to say except for how wonderful the time was together. We went home to make dinner. We made green bean casserole, bread, mashed potatoes, and salad. I had tried some anchovies at the italian restaurant the night before and loved them, so I was craving some more on my salad. We had stopped by the grocery store on the way home from the beach. After dinner, we relaxed and sat around for the evening. Star Wars was on TV, so we layed on the couch and watched it. After it ended, we watched American Pickers. I love that show. We began to dose off in each others arms. After a while, I realized I was asleep. I woke up and opened my eyes to see Clara, two inches from my face with my arms wrapped around her. I was absolutely overwhelmed with happiness. It was one of the most intense feelings I&#39;ve ever felt. I really don&#39;t know what is was, why I was feeling it, or where it came from. It was absolute bliss. I don&#39;t know how to explain it. I think part of it was being half asleep and just being wrapped into Clara. It felt so good. Since we were falling asleep, both of us were tired, we got up and headed off to our beds.&nbsp;','','','private','open','open','','594','','','2012-07-12 02:36:00','2012-07-12 02:36:00','',0,'http://jrstrauss.net/journal/?p=594',0,'post','',0),(595,2,'2012-07-17 14:39:00','2012-07-17 14:39:00','I&#39;ve never been so torn between two things in my entire life.

God gave me a heart to follow for a reason. He did not simply put me on this earth to follow rules, but to live life to its fullest.\r\n\r\nAnd life to its fullest means something different for every man. And that\'s why he gave me my head to use to my own advantage. I take what I learn from the Bible very liberally. I do not follow it word for word, nor do I agree with everything it says. Yet even then, I do not think it always leads me in the right direction when I follow it too strictly. There are too many contradictions to do so. God\'s word is not about rules, but about love. Do not misinterpret, I believe the word is a huge source of guidance that every man should look to for every decision he makes, but so many simply do not know how to read it. I\'m exaggerating a little and being a tad disrespectful, but trying to communicate my perspective without being able to easily do so. But what if God added these contradictions that we not listen to everything we are told but to learn from life and follow our hearts? I\'ve certainly learned that had I followed everything the church taught me and tried to live out the prude, closed-minded perspective of today\'s christians, I would not be living life to its fullest. I would be living a life that, to me, could not be its happiest.\r\n\r\nBut I\'ve carefully listened for God. I\'ve squinted my eyes, tried hard to see what\'s right, and attempted to follow after that small speck of light. I\'ve always done my best. And that\'s why I\'m completely happy.

I know you might not ever want to hear from me again, but I will give you the benefit of the doubt in the case that it will settle curiosity, peace of mind, or in the very least, interest. Today I was going through a box of old letters and read a few from you, still as crisp and neat as the day I got them. You were sweet to me, open, and understanding. I have a couple memories otherwise, but I think they are merely distortions of my perception at the time due to my hypersensitive emotions. I want you to know that you were (and probably still are) sweet and caring to me. You had a lot of sense and understanding and probably handled our situation exactly as it should have been handled, which is probably not true of my behavior from my end. It\'s been too long for me to truly know for sure, but of what little evidence I have of the communication between you and me, what I\'ve seen doesn\'t look like I treated you reasonably. That\'s not to say that I truly mistreated you--I don\'t think that is true--but I think that I could have been better. Well, I couldn\'t have been better, but I should have been. Had I known any better,\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI\'ve learned a lot about myself in the past 6 years, and I can tell you that any way I treated you was not because I was a mean person or that I had bad intentions, but because I cared about you so much and wanted you in my life so badly that I eventually got to the point of desperation which completely distorts our own perception of how to act and how to not act. Regardless of how I acted or you acted or who was right and who was wrong, none of which I remember well enough to know either way, I want to extend an apology to you for anything in between--for what I did, for what I didn\'t do, for what I shouldn\'t have done, and for what I didn\'t know to do. I\'m making these judgements based on the fact that you haven\'t talked to me since, and clearly had no desire to do so many years ago. I can\'t do much, but I can tell you I\'m sorry. Even if I never was before, I am now.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI was always confused as to why you wouldn\'t talk to me. I\'m sure there was reason for a while, but I had hoped and expected that some time it would fade away and at least move in the positive direction, if only slightly, yet it only continued to move in the negative. For a long time, I did what I needed to do to rid myself of any attraction to you, which took many years, believe it or not, and I presume that is what caused so much harm, of all the things we ever went though. I want you to know that I feel no feelings of negativity to you in any way, regardless of what that might mean to you. I have many negative memories of us and feelings of hopelessness, but I\'ve shelved them away and dusted off the positive over the years and moved them to the front. I still remember what it was like the first day I met you and the power you had over me and my heart. I was such a helpless young man, and such a slave to my feelings. I still am really. You were so beautiful then, and I believe that if I knew you today, you still would be. Both inside your heart and outside in your presence.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI really, really hope that you are doing well. I really, really hope that you are happy. I hope that Boston was everything you ever dreamed it was and I hope that you\'ve found a happy life in what it\'s been after you knew me. You don\'t ever have to want to talk to me again, and that\'s perfectly okay, but I want to offer you a hand as a lost friend and any other benevolence that I can offer. I am still the exact same boy that you once knew and though I haven\'t changed much, I have certainly grown. And you were a huge part of that. And you gave me years and years of growth, even after I never knew you any more. There was a time in my life, long after you kindly let me out of your life that I didn\'t think I would ever stop struggling with the hole you left in it. And I was always surprised with how that was--I\'m sure I took things way too seriously. But it was mostly for how badly I wanted you and my life, yet that\'s just not how it works. Thank you for treating me how you did. Thank you for pushing me away when you realized you weren\'t happy. Thank you for being down to earth, blunt, and honest. Thank you for standing up for yourself. And most of all, thank you for not putting up with my emotions of desperation. Honestly, you probably put up with them much more than you should have.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI don\'t expect a response, and you certainly don\'t have to, but if it means anything to you and you would like to, I am completely open to hearing from you. Whether it\'s short, long, criticism, openness, small talk, an update, or a giant list of all the things you hated about me--I don\'t care--I will be open to anything and would love to hear from you regardless of what the content is. And if you\'re curious at all as to what my life is like or who I am these days, I will gladly tell you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf anything, I hope this letter is one of encouragement to you. You were such a light in my life and and though you were a very painful light, you taught me a lot and made me feel things I\'ve never felt before. You made me happier than anyone I had ever known. I still remember the feelings you made me feel that were unique in a way that no one has ever made me feel since--because you are your very own unique person that is different from anyone else. If I never hear from you again, I wish you the very best and hope that your life is a wonderful adventure full of twists, turns, surprises, and excitement.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLove from your old friend,\r\n\r\nRussell Strauss','to cyndi','','inherit','open','closed','','650-revision-2','','','2012-08-27 23:40:56','2012-08-28 03:40:56','',650,'http://journal.rruffles.com/650-revision-2/',0,'revision','',0),(653,2,'2012-08-27 23:56:55','2012-08-28 03:56:55','Dear Cyndi,\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI hope this letter brings you in good faith, good fortune, and times of happiness.

Had I known any better.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI\'ve learned a lot about myself in the past 6 years, and I can tell you that any way I treated you was not because I was a mean person or that I had bad intentions, but because I cared about you so much and wanted you in my life so badly that I eventually got to the point of desperation which completely distorts our own perception of how to act and how not to act. Regardless of how I acted or you acted or who was right and who was wrong, none of which I remember well enough to know either way, I want to extend an apology to you for anything in between--for what I did, for what I didn\'t do, for what I shouldn\'t have done, and for what I didn\'t know to do. I\'m making these judgements based on the fact that you haven\'t talked to me since then, and clearly had no desire to do so many years ago. I can\'t do much, but I can tell you I\'m sorry. Even if I never was before, I am now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI was always confused as to why you wouldn\'t talk to me. I\'m sure there was reason for a while, but I had hoped and expected that some time it would fade away and at least move in the positive direction, if only slightly. Yet, it only continued to move in the negative. For a long time, I did what I needed to do to rid myself of any attraction to you, which took many years, believe it or not, and I presume that is what caused so much harm, of all the things we ever went though. I want you to know that I have no feelings of negativity to you in any way, regardless of what that might mean to you. I have many negative memories of us and feelings of hopelessness, but I\'ve shelved them away and dusted off the positive over the years and moved them to the front. I still remember what it was like the first day I met you and the power you had over me and my heart. I was such a helpless young man, and such a slave to my feelings. I still am, really. You were so beautiful then, and I believe that if I knew you today, you still would be. Both inside your heart and outside with your presence.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI really, really hope that you are doing well. I really, really hope that you are happy. I hope that Boston was everything you ever dreamed it was, and I hope that you\'ve found a happy life in what it\'s been after you knew me. You don\'t ever have to want to talk to me again, and that\'s perfectly okay, but I want to offer you a hand as a lost friend and any other benevolence that I can offer. I am still the exact same boy that you once knew, and though I haven\'t changed much, I have certainly grown. And you were a huge part of that. And you gave me years and years of growth, even after I never knew you any more. There was a time in my life, long after you kindly let me out of your life that I didn\'t think I would ever stop struggling with the hole you left in it. And I was always surprised with how that was--I\'m sure I took things way too seriously. But it was mostly for how badly I wanted you in my life, yet that\'s just not how it works. Thank you for treating me how you did. Thank you for pushing me away when you realized you weren\'t happy. Thank you for being down to earth, blunt, and honest. Thank you for standing up for yourself. And most of all, thank you for not putting up with my emotions of desperation. Honestly, you probably put up with them much more than you should have.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI don\'t expect a response, and you certainly don\'t have to, but if it means anything to you and you would like to, I am completely open to hearing from you. Whether it\'s short, long, criticism, openness, small talk, an update, or a giant list of all the things you hated about me--I don\'t care--I will be open to anything and would love to hear from you regardless of what the content is. And if you\'re curious at all as to what my life is like or who I am these days, I will gladly tell you.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf anything, I hope this letter is one of encouragement to you. You were such a light in my life and and though you were a very painful light, you taught me a lot and made me feel things I\'ve never felt before. You made me happier than anyone I had ever known. I still remember the feelings you made me feel that were unique in a way that no one has ever made me feel since--because you are your very own unique person that is different from anyone else. If I never hear from you again, I wish you the very best and hope that your life is a wonderful adventure full of twists, turns, surprises, and excitement.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLove from your old friend,\n\nRussell Strauss','to cyndi','','inherit','open','closed','','650-autosave','','','2012-08-27 23:56:55','2012-08-28 03:56:55','',650,'http://journal.rruffles.com/650-autosave/',0,'revision','',0),(654,2,'2012-08-28 14:57:13','2012-08-28 18:57:13','There is a time in every man\'s education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion; that though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till...Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist.

I’m fine with it most days but then there are certain moments, such as these, when I’m suffocated by the weight of my own failures. I’ve pretended for so long that this part of me was shut off, damaged goods, that it just wasn’t ever going to happen for me. I became resigned and defeated. Content with my discontent.\n\nThen the fire will spark and I’ll feel cheated. All of a sudden, I want to get what’s owed to me. I want to get more than what I currently have.\n\nI’m talking here about love, of course. The act of getting it and then sustaining the connection. Growing up, I always knew that I had a lot of love to give. I felt everything; I felt everyone. I’m always placing my hand on a friend’s body out of habit just so I can be closer to them. There’s no such thing as too close. I’m always looking for connections wherever I go.\n\n<em>Remind me why I’m here. C’mere.</em>\n\nI imagined my young adult life to be spent in a series of different people’s beds, limbs entangled, light peeking through the window, fingertips going up and down the back to initiate morning sex. I can so clearly visualize the scene: I’m cooking breakfast for someone. Music is wafting through the laptop speakers and I’m watching a man get dressed. I’m watching his ass, the curve of his back, as he gets clothed and moves forward to kiss me goodbye. Then, when he leaves, the energy will get sucked from the room, the spell will be broken, and I’ll need to go get it again.\n\nSounds familiar, right? Sounds like something that’s plucked from the pages of your life? I know it is because I’ve been studying it. But despite all of my desire and wanting, there’s been no naked backs hanging from the edge of my bed, no quick passionate kisses goodbye while I’m still half-asleep. There’s been nothing.\n\nBecause of this, I don’t understand the motions of sex and love. I am not a part of the club.\n\nOf course, a lot of these failures have to do with me. You can only blame others for so long before realizing that you are a part of the problem. Perhaps what’s more adult than wearing your lover’s shirt and cooking breakfast for them in the morning is coming to the realization that you’re screwed up. Something inside of you broke and it’s up to you to fix it.\n\nHere’s another familiar scene for you: You look around a room that’s full of your friends and realize you are the only one who isn’t spoken for. Everyone else is clutching on to the arm of their partner while your grip on the bottle of wine stiffens.\n\nAnother one: You go on a family vacation and realize you are the only one who didn’t bring a significant other. You get to sleep on the pullout because it’s only you and it’s better for one person to be uncomfortable rather than two. <em>Actually, I guarantee that I’m the one who will be in more pain BECAUSE I’m alone.</em>\n\nLast one: A man brushes your shoulder on the subway and your body practically has convulsions. It’s then that you realize that you haven’t been touched in a long time.\n\nIt’s easy to sit here and ask, “When will I be spoken for? When will I have someone to bring on the family vacation? When will I get used to someone’s touch?”\n\nWhen will it be my turn to fall in love?\n\nI don’t know. No one knows. Stop buying the books that tell you when because they’re merely profiting off of your vulnerabilities. Just focus on yourself and pray that the fire never stops sparking. Pray that you never get used to all of this because the second you do, it’s yours forever.','when will it be my turn to fall in love?','','inherit','open','closed','','666-revision','','','2012-09-17 21:47:09','2012-09-18 01:47:09','',666,'http://journal.rruffles.com/666-revision/',0,'revision','',0),(668,2,'2012-09-22 04:01:49','2012-09-22 08:01:49','I\'ve never had anyone treat me like such shit.

After growing up with her in the family, taking care and neutralizing every single emotional crisis and conflict, it was something I could not miss. I was amazed by her ability to put her own needs so far behind her and give them away to us. It was a bittersweet desire. I admired the ability, yet I did not want the responsibility of learning how to live without having my needs met, shoving everything to the back to make room for my family\'s well-being. Though I didn\'t worry about this bittersweet desire, for I didn\'t believe I was like that. I didn\'t believe it was an ability I possessed. I believed it was a talent my mother was blessed with--that I don\'t see in anyone else in my family--that I was not blessed with. I didn\'t believe that I had that ability, but deep down inside I wanted it when I grew older.\r\n\r\nYet, I am beginning to see it in myself. And it grows bigger and bigger everyday. Will I one day be like my mother, much more worried about the most precious relationships in my life, when their behavior is completely irrational, selfish, and unjustified? Am I falling into a life of unconditional and seeming bottomless prioritization of others over my own needs? Who will care for me? Who will look out for me? What about the times when those that I love and look to for support are those that tear my world apart? I am beginning to see this in my own life.

I’m fine with it most days but then there are certain moments, such as these, when I’m suffocated by the weight of my own failures. I’ve pretended for so long that this part of me was shut off, damaged goods, that it just wasn’t ever going to happen for me. I became resigned and defeated. Content with my discontent.\r\n\r\nThen the fire will spark and I’ll feel cheated. All of a sudden, I want to get what’s owed to me. I want to get more than what I currently have.\r\n\r\nI’m talking here about love, of course. The act of getting it and then sustaining the connection. Growing up, I always knew that I had a lot of love to give. I felt everything; I felt everyone. I’m always placing my hand on a friend’s body out of habit just so I can be closer to them. There’s no such thing as too close. I’m always looking for connections wherever I go.\r\n\r\n<em>Remind me why I’m here. C’mere.</em>\r\n\r\nI imagined my young adult life to be spent in a series of different people’s beds, limbs entangled, light peeking through the window, fingertips going up and down the back to initiate morning sex. I can so clearly visualize the scene: I’m cooking breakfast for someone. Music is wafting through the laptop speakers and I’m watching a man get dressed. I’m watching his ass, the curve of his back, as he gets clothed and moves forward to kiss me goodbye. Then, when he leaves, the energy will get sucked from the room, the spell will be broken, and I’ll need to go get it again.\r\n\r\nSounds familiar, right? Sounds like something that’s plucked from the pages of your life? I know it is because I’ve been studying it. But despite all of my desire and wanting, there’s been no naked backs hanging from the edge of my bed, no quick passionate kisses goodbye while I’m still half-asleep. There’s been nothing.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, I don’t understand the motions of sex and love. I am not a part of the club.\r\n\r\nOf course, a lot of these failures have to do with me. You can only blame others for so long before realizing that you are a part of the problem. Perhaps what’s more adult than wearing your lover’s shirt and cooking breakfast for them in the morning is coming to the realization that you’re screwed up. Something inside of you broke and it’s up to you to fix it.\r\n\r\nHere’s another familiar scene for you: You look around a room that’s full of your friends and realize you are the only one who isn’t spoken for. Everyone else is clutching on to the arm of their partner while your grip on the bottle of wine stiffens.\r\n\r\nAnother one: You go on a family vacation and realize you are the only one who didn’t bring a significant other. You get to sleep on the pullout because it’s only you and it’s better for one person to be uncomfortable rather than two. <em>Actually, I guarantee that I’m the one who will be in more pain BECAUSE I’m alone.</em>\r\n\r\nLast one: A man brushes your shoulder on the subway and your body practically has convulsions. It’s then that you realize that you haven’t been touched in a long time.\r\n\r\nIt’s easy to sit here and ask, “When will I be spoken for? When will I have someone to bring on the family vacation? When will I get used to someone’s touch?”\r\n\r\nWhen will it be my turn to fall in love?\r\n\r\nI don’t know. No one knows. Stop buying the books that tell you when because they’re merely profiting off of your vulnerabilities. Just focus on yourself and pray that the fire never stops sparking. Pray that you never get used to all of this because the second you do, it’s yours forever.','when will it be my turn to fall in love?','','inherit','open','closed','','666-revision-2','','','2012-09-17 21:47:23','2012-09-18 01:47:23','',666,'http://journal.rruffles.com/666-revision-2/',0,'revision','',0),(689,2,'2012-09-04 15:48:07','2012-09-04 19:48:07','God I love the way you whisper \"baby\" into my ear.

I know you might not ever want to hear from me again, but I will give you the benefit of the doubt in the case that it will settle curiosity, peace of mind, or in the very least, interest. Today I was going through a box of old letters and read a few from you, still as crisp and neat as the day I got them. You were sweet to me, open, and understanding. I have a couple memories otherwise, but I think they are merely distortions of my perception at the time due to my hypersensitive emotions. I want you to know that you were (and probably still are) sweet and caring to me. You had a lot of sense and understanding and probably handled our situation exactly as it should have been handled, which is probably not true of the behavior from my end. It\'s been too long for me to truly know for sure, but of what little evidence I have of the communication between you and me, what I\'ve seen doesn\'t look like I treated you reasonably. That\'s not to say that I truly mistreated you--I don\'t think that is true--but I think that I could have been better. Well, I couldn\'t have been better, but I should have been. Had I known any better.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI\'ve learned a lot about myself in the past 6 years, and I can tell you that any way I treated you was not because I was a mean person or that I had bad intentions, but because I cared about you so much and wanted you in my life so badly that I eventually got to the point of desperation which completely distorts our own perception of how to act and how not to act. Regardless of how I acted or you acted or who was right and who was wrong, none of which I remember well enough to know either way, I want to extend an apology to you for anything in between--for what I did, for what I didn\'t do, for what I shouldn\'t have done, and for what I didn\'t know to do. I\'m making these judgements based on the fact that you haven\'t talked to me since then, and clearly had no desire to do so many years ago. I can\'t do much, but I can tell you I\'m sorry. Even if I never was before, I am now.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI was always confused as to why you wouldn\'t talk to me. I\'m sure there was reason for a while, but I had hoped and expected that some time it would fade away and at least move in the positive direction, if only slightly. Yet, it only continued to move in the negative. For a long time, I did what I needed to do to rid myself of any attraction to you, which took many years, believe it or not, and I presume that is what caused so much harm, of all the things we ever went though. I want you to know that I have no feelings of negativity to you in any way, regardless of what that might mean to you. I have many negative memories of us and feelings of hopelessness, but I\'ve shelved them away and dusted off the positive over the years and moved them to the front. I still remember what it was like the first day I met you and the power you had over me and my heart. I was such a helpless young man, and such a slave to my feelings. I still am, really. You were so beautiful then, and I believe that if I knew you today, you still would be. Both inside your heart and outside with your presence.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI really, really hope that you are doing well. I really, really hope that you are happy. I hope that Boston was everything you ever dreamed it was, and I hope that you\'ve found a happy life in what it\'s been after you knew me. You don\'t ever have to want to talk to me again, and that\'s perfectly okay, but I want to offer you a hand as a lost friend and any other benevolence that I can offer. I am still the exact same boy that you once knew, and though I haven\'t changed much, I have certainly grown. And you were a huge part of that. And you gave me years and years of growth, even after I never knew you any more. There was a time in my life, long after you kindly let me out of your life that I didn\'t think I would ever stop struggling with the hole you left in it. And I was always surprised with how that was--I\'m sure I took things way too seriously. But it was mostly for how badly I wanted you in my life, yet that\'s just not how it works. Thank you for treating me how you did. Thank you for pushing me away when you realized you weren\'t happy. Thank you for being down to earth, blunt, and honest. Thank you for standing up for yourself. And most of all, thank you for not putting up with my emotions of desperation. Honestly, you probably put up with them much more than you should have.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI don\'t expect a response, and you certainly don\'t have to, but if it means anything to you and you would like to, I am completely open to hearing from you. Whether it\'s short, long, criticism, openness, small talk, an update, or a giant list of all the things you hated about me--I don\'t care--I will be open to anything and would love to hear from you regardless of what the content is. And if you\'re curious at all as to what my life is like or who I am these days, I will gladly tell you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf anything, I hope this letter is one of encouragement to you. You were such a light in my life and and though you were a very painful light, you taught me a lot and made me feel things I\'ve never felt before. You made me happier than anyone I had ever known. I still remember the feelings you made me feel that were unique in a way that no one has ever made me feel since--because you are your very own unique person that is different from anyone else. If I never hear from you again, I wish you the very best and hope that your life is a wonderful adventure full of twists, turns, surprises, and excitement.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLove from your old friend,\r\n\r\nRussell Strauss','to cyndi','','inherit','open','closed','','650-revision-3','','','2012-08-27 23:55:53','2012-08-28 03:55:53','',650,'http://journal.rruffles.com/650-revision-3/',0,'revision','',0),(694,2,'2012-08-22 12:53:33','2012-08-22 17:53:33','I did my best.

I will always fight to be the better person. I will always offer the treatment that I wish I could receive from you. Though I am doubtful, I pray that it will one day pay off.\r\n\r\nWhen I was younger, I wished to be like my mother. She is a bottomless fountain of mercy. She is a bottomless fountain of wisdom. After growing up with her in the family, taking care and neutralizing every single emotional crisis and conflict, it was something I could not miss. I was amazed by her ability to put her own needs so far behind her and give them away to us. It was a bittersweet desire. I admired the ability, yet I did not want the responsibility of learning how to live without having my needs met, shoving everything to the back to make room for my family\'s well-being. Though I didn\'t worry about this bittersweet desire, for I didn\'t believe I was like that. I didn\'t believe it was an ability I possessed. I believed it was a talent my mother was blessed with--that I don\'t see in anyone else in my family--that I was not blessed with. I didn\'t believe that I had that ability, but deep down inside I wanted it when I grew older.\r\n\r\nYet, I am beginning to see it in myself. And it grows bigger and bigger everyday. Will I one day be like my mother, much more worried about the most precious relationships in my life, when their behavior is completely irrational, selfish, and unjustified? Am I falling into a life of unconditional and seeming bottomless prioritization of others over my own needs? Who will care for me? Who will look out for me? What about the times when those that I love and look to for support are those that tear my world apart? I am beginning to see this in my own life. My doubts reside in what this will mean for me--does it mean my efforts will be doubled back by love and support or that I\'m simply diving without safety nets?\r\n\r\nWell here\'s the start. You have lied to me. You have cheated me out of what I wanted for my own life. You used your own selfish confusions to take advantage of me, what I wanted, and what I had planned for. You made me challenge my own values in ways that were not healthy for me and in ways that perpetuated your own misguided search for which you don\'t even know what. You made me realize that I am nothing but a worthless human. You made me realize that I am less than I ever thought I was. You made me realize I am nothing but a fool.\r\n\r\nYou brought me down with you. And the worst part about it is that you didn\'t bring me down, you influenced me to come down with you. Even worse, it was a pure, raw decision--a decision that no one made except myself. You couldn\'t force me to do anything. I made the decision myself. And you made me want it. You made me want it with absolutely no repercussions to your own well-being. And that\'s what hurts the most. Because after everything is said and done, it means nothing to you. It means nothing to you what I go through. It means nothing to you where I came from. I had no idea I was diving into my own suicide. I thought I was diving into an era of safety, of support. Yet I took a leap of faith, put my trust in you, and felt my stomach pass through my head as I began to free-fall, looking to you in fear and finding you no where in sight.\r\n\r\nYou\'ve taught me that no one will ever provide the support that I need other than myself.

Yet I took a leap of faith, put my trust in you, and felt my stomach pass through my head as I began to free-fall, looking to you in fear and finding you nowhere in sight.\r\n\r\nYou\'ve taught me that no one will ever provide the support that I need other than myself. You\'ve taught me that I will always fend for myself. You\'ve taught me that I am my own greatest resource on this Earth for anything I will ever need.

If a company wants to hire you at $100,000, definitely they are planning to profit more than 100K themselves, probably much more. Otherwise they won\'t hire you. Companies are not in business for some other worldly altruistic cause, they want to make lots of profit out of your labor. So, they very much want to hire you. In fact they are desperate. E.g. Facebook &amp; Google competition.\r\n\r\nThe paradox is, even when the company\'s want/need for you is desperately crazy, they try to hide it in the \'people market\'. In fact they behave as if they really don\'t need you, as if they are doing you some extra-ordinary favor by employing you. In fact what they are actually doing in this \'trade negotiation\', is trying to downgrade your value, at the beginning of negotiations. They imply that you need them more than they need you. All their tactics of recruiting are geared toward this.\r\n\r\nTo counter this, first, you need to aware of it &amp; second, join together with other top people in an online group, where you discuss employers. Discuss the whole process of recruiting &amp; whether it is fair &amp; equal.\r\n\r\nStart from discussion of the advertisement itself. E.g if they want to know your salary right at the start, should they not include it in their ad, then give at least give a reasonably narrow salary range budgeted for that position. That would be equal &amp; fair. In some countries that actually is the standard practice.\r\n\r\nPractices we take for granted as \'unchangeable\' do get changed. E.g. in SV, the VC community has recently realized this (the two way traffic) when the entrepreneurs decided that not taking investor money is actually better in for them.\r\n\r\nIf the recruiters are \'partnering\' with the company, is it not their professional duty to inform their client company about this two way street &amp; refuse to deal with companies who insist on being unprofessional?','','','publish','open','closed','','756','','','2017-04-20 16:19:04','2017-04-20 20:19:04','',0,'http://journal.rruffles.com/?p=756',0,'post','',0),(758,2,'2013-04-10 10:58:48','2013-04-10 14:58:48','Maybe I don\'t really want to know how your garden grows. I just want to fly. Lately have you felt the pain in the morning rain as it soaks it to the bone?\r\n\r\nMaybe I just want to fly. I want to live; I don\'t want to die. Maybe I just want to breath. Maybe I just don\'t believe. Maybe you\'re the same as me. We see things they\'ll never see. You and I are going to live forever.\r\n\r\nMaybe I will never be all the things that I want to be. But now is not the time to cry. Now\'s the time to find out why. I think you\'re the same as me. We see things they\'ll never see. You and I are going to live forever.','You and I are going to live forever.','','publish','open','closed','','you-and-i-are-going-to-live-forever','','','2013-04-10 10:58:48','2013-04-10 14:58:48','',0,'http://journal.rruffles.com/?p=758',0,'post','',0),(759,2,'2013-04-10 10:58:25','2013-04-10 14:58:25','Maybe I don\'t really want to know how your garden grows. I just want to fly. Lately have you felt the pain in the morning rain as it soaks it to the bone?\n\nMaybe I just want to fly. I want to live; I don\'t want to die. Maybe I just want to breath. Maybe I just don\'t believe. Maybe you\'re the same as me. We see things they\'ll never see. You and I are going to live forever.\n\nMaybe I will never be all the things that I want to be. But now is not the time to cry. Now\'s the time to find out why. I think you\'re the same as me\nWe see things they\'ll never see\nYou and I are gonna live forever\nWe\'re gonna live forever\n\nGonna live forever\nLive forever\nForever','You and I are going to live forever.','','inherit','open','closed','','758-revision','','','2013-04-10 10:58:25','2013-04-10 14:58:25','',758,'http://journal.rruffles.com/758-revision/',0,'revision','',0),(841,2,'2015-12-19 10:46:05','2015-12-19 15:46:05','I had the most wonderful weekend. Clara and I waited all summer to see each other. I finally got the chance to fly out and visit. I hadn\'t seen her for 8 weeks. I booked the flight about 4 weeks before the trip and the wait was killing us. But it finally came. It\'s finally come and gone, and that\'s weird to me. I was so outrageously anxious all summer long, and now it\'s over. But luckily, in the same way, she be back here before long. The end of the summer will come and go just in the same way. And that\'s what I tell myself. Time goes quickly when you only worry about today. Now that I\'m working, time flies by. It\'s strange.\n\nBut the time had finally come...thinking about it, I just can\'t get over the fact that it\'s over. It\'s so weird. It\'s like a dream. I guess that\'s why I want to preserve it forever right here. The time finally came and I made my journey to the airport. I was so excited. I couldn\'t contain myself. Many, many longs weeks, days, hours, and minutes of wait, but I finally landed in Minnesota. I walked outside, I was power walking, almost running, and looked for Clara. I didn\'t see her anywhere. It was intensely hot. I called her, but she didn\'t answer. I walked around for a minute, and then she called back. She was at baggage claim. I told her I was outside. I started walking inside but suddenly saw her coming up the escalator. I yelled at her to turn around and slammed up against the glass. We looked at each other, grinned ear to ear. I just sat there and she looked at me like, \"What are you crazy?? Get in here!!\" I sprinted inside and toward her. I tried to hug her, she tried to kiss me. It was awkward and funny. We kissed in the middle of the airport, so happy to be with each other, but we almost too excited to do so. We said hello and excitedly ran out the door. The ride home was lots of \"I can\'t believe you\'re here! I can\'t believe I\'m here!\" It was wonderful. We got to enjoy the hour long drive alone and take in what it was like to be together again.\n\nWe had planned to go see a movie that night and were both excited about it. Clara was hungry, so she wanted to get home and change so we could go eat. We went by the grocery store on the way to pick up milk and ice cream. We went home changed, and finally left for the nearest movie theatre in a downtown square in a nearby town named Excelsior. We went to an italian restaurant in the square for dinner and had a wonderful, fancy, small, and expensive dinner with a bottle of wine. Before we left, she had said I could pick out her outfit. I told her that she couldn\'t just say no to whatever I picked, so I picked something. She looked at me, said \"Are you kidding me?\" and immediately said know. Because of that, I had been in a pretty bad mood the whole way there, so the wine helped with that and let me let go of it. We sat by the lake and then walked into the movie across the street. It was funny because we sat in the wrong theatre at first and didn\'t even realize it until the movei started. It was the tiniest little theatre, with only two movies playing. Our theatre only had five rows. Hilarious. It was a movie called Moonrise Kingdom. We enjoyed the movie then headed home. We were anxious to get on hands on each other, but couldn\'t do that at home. I wanted to more than she did. We talked about parking, but she didn\'t like the idea. She hadn\'t done it since high school. Neither had I. We parked and sat there for a second, but a car drove by, slowly, then slower, then slower, then stopped. So we started up the car and left. She wasn\'t willing to try anything else. I was mad.\n\nWe went home with my irritation and I sat in her room alone. I told her I wanted to be alone. She said hello to her dad, but then eventually came in. She comforted me. I instantly knew everything was going to be alright. We had been struggling keeping each other happy all summer, but when we were together, all of that was gone. I had been terrified all summer that we would get back together and something would have changed since the previous semester. But it just reaffirmed everything that I had thought. We were both wonderful together, it was just the distance that was giving us so much trouble. Something about being apart just kept us from functioning. Yet, when we were together, all of that was gone. And in this moment, I was so satisfied to know that. So hopeful and optimistic. It was a big moment for me that confirmed that everything would be alright. We went on her porch and ate ice cream. It was a wonderful time. We sat and looked at each other and talked, comfortable. Her mom came in after a while, angry that she was eating after midnight, the night before the tests. We talked about what life was like in Minnesota and how much we missed each other. She cried and we held each other. It was so great to have each other to comfort. Before long, we decided to go to bed because we had to wake up early the next morning to go to the doctor to do some tests for her stomach issues, so we went to bed after that. We didn\'t get much sleep. I slept in her room, and she slept in her basement.\n\nWe woke up at 6:30. I was tired, but I felt alright. Just happy to be with Clara. She had gotten pretty upset earlier in the week when she found out she had to get up and go to the doctor to have some tests done during my visit. We got ready and headed to the hospital. She would have to eat radioactive eggs and get MRI\'s as they digested. She said that eggs usually made her feel bad and she didn\'t want to feel bad all day during our short time together, which is why she was upset about having to do the tests, along with having to wake up early. It took her a couple of hours, but her mom and I got some breakfast and coffee in the hospital cafe after a little bit. The bagel I ate was amazing. It was untoasted, but still so good. Just about the time we sat down, Clara came out of the tests. She had only been in there thirty or forty-five minutes, but she had to let the food digest before they took more pictures. Her coming out made all the difference. I thought I would have to sit alone with her mom all morning, but we got to stay together for the rest of the morning, mostly. She felt worse and worse the longer we stayed there. She got sick in the bathroom before we left, so I tried to comfort her there and on the way home. When we got home we took a nap in her room since we were both exhausted. I tried to fall asleep and came so frustratingly close, but then couldn\'t. The coffee I had was keeping me up. We eventually got up and found a note in the kitchen. The family had gone out to eat for lunch. We got alone time. We went back to bed and enjoyed the alone time. Though, her family came back before we were done and had to finish quickly.\n\nWe had decided to go swimming that afternoon in a nearby lake. I wanted to go pick out a bathing suit since I hadn\'t owned one in years. We went by Kohl\'s and found some really great cheap bathing suits. I even found my favorite Adidas sandals on sale for an amazing price! I was so pumped about all of it. I got two great suits for twelve bucks each and the sandals for only twenty dollars. Super excited we headed off to the beach. Before that though, she took me to a tobacco shop in the nearby downtown area. It was the coolest tobacco shop I\'ve ever been in. They had so much pipe tobacco. I found this cool humidor that was cheap, so I decided to buy it. My dad had given me money for the trip and I emptied my entire high school change savings, so I had a little bit of money, which made the weekend so much better. We looked at the pipes. She found one she liked, but decided to wait to get it. As we left, we both could tell she really, really wanted it. It was a nice pipe for a decent price, and she seemed to be picky about them. Before we had gotten to the car, we laughed together and decided to go back and get it. It was so fun.\n\nWe went to the beach and had a great time swimming. We just had a beautiful hour together, holding on to each other and enjoy our closeness and undivided attention. She was super into me at the moment. I loved it. We were happy. We got out after a while to lay on the beach before we left. There really isn\'t much to say except for how wonderful the time was together. We went home to make dinner. We made green bean casserole, bread, mashed potatoes, and salad. I had tried some anchovies at the italian restaurant the night before and loved them, so I was craving some more on my salad. We had stopped by the grocery store on the way home from the beach. After dinner, we relaxed and sat around for the evening. Star Wars was on TV, so we layed on the couch and watched it. After it ended, we watched American Pickers. I love that show. We began to dose off in each others arms. After a while, I realized I was asleep. I woke up and opened my eyes to see Clara, two inches from my face with my arms wrapped around her. I was absolutely overwhelmed with happiness. It was one of the most intense feelings I\'ve ever felt. I really don\'t know what is was, why I was feeling it, or where it came from. It was absolute bliss. I don\'t know how to explain it. I think part of it was being half asleep and just being wrapped into Clara. It felt so good. Since we were falling asleep, both of us were tired, we got up and headed off to our beds.','','','inherit','open','closed','','594-autosave-v1','','','2015-12-19 10:46:05','2015-12-19 15:46:05','',594,'http://journal.rruffles.com/594-autosave-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(762,2,'2013-04-29 00:33:07','2013-04-29 04:33:07','5.

You\'ll be back in the U.S./society in no time and wishing you were back in New Zealand, but don\'t fall into the trap of always wishing you were somewhere else. Hiking is great but so is the joy of gaining your own independence in other ways that are more sustainable.

Before long, a group of four dark figures walked up, one carrying a flash light. They didn\'t look like the law, so I quickly put the joint away and sat there. They came up to me, man with flashlight in front, and he leaned down in front of me. He told me that he was with a charity and asked me if I want any food.

I should have done it long ago, while it was still fresh in my memory, but the longer I wait, the foggier it will get. Only months later, and it\'s already starting to fade. It\'s so sad, because they\'re some of the most precious memories I\'ve ever made in my entire life. I\'m so passionately dreading the day when I can\'t remember every little single detail of those three weeks of my life--and that is already starting to happen. I would give anything to have every moment perfectly documented out and preserved forever. So I must remember everything I can possibly remember before it fades away.\n\nOn one Saturday night, 3 weeks before my college graduation--the last semester of my senior year of college, I went to a party at my good friend Lee\'s. It was April 14th, 2012. He had these parties often--probably once a month, and my best friend David and I had been frequenting them quite often that semester in particular. They weren\'t always packed, and they weren\'t always crazy, but sometimes they were, and they were most usually always fun. I got to see the circle of friends that would always be there, so I enjoyed going to see them and have a good time. This one in particular was one of the last. There weren\'t that many people there because they had just had one recently, but in the end, it was a solid group of people and everyone ended up having a wonderful time. There had been a girl I had somewhat expressed interest in, and I wanted to take her and show her how much fun my group of friends had when they party, yet I never expected I would meet someone that would completely change my life.\n\nI knew most everyone there. I met a couple new faces, and then had gotten acquainted with basically everyone at the party. I had a pretty big reputation among this group of friends, so it typically wasn\'t difficult to make friends with everyone there. Although, there were two girls whom I didn\'t recognize after I knew everyone, so I just decided to introduce myself.\n\n-\"Hey, I\'m Megan.\"\n-\"And I\'m Clara.\"\n-\"Clara?\"\n-\"Yeah.\"\n-\"Cool, hey.\"\n\nThey\'re both very attractive young ladies, and they seemed to be having a very good time, but Clara was absolutely stunning. The longer I looked at her, the more beautiful I realized she was. I didn\'t talk to them really, but continued to mingle and have fun. Later in the night, Clara was nearby as I was talking to someone, and she grabbed my glasses and my hat off of me. It was my favorite hat of all time--the Cleveland Indians hat from my little league baseball team that I had from when I was a litte kid. I was desperately terrified of losing it whenever I took it out of the house. I thought about trying to grab it back, I might have even tried, but thought to myself, \"Well, I guess I\'m not getting that back right away. I\'ll get it back later.\" I thoroughly enjoyed the attention from her, so I was relaxed about it. I knew it would give me an excuse to talk to her later.\n\nTime passed, and I eventually went to the dance floor where I saw her, along with Megan and their friend William, dancing. Megan and William were dancing together. Clara had on the cutest red dress on, and I just couldn\'t get over how adorable she was. She was still wearing my hat and glasses. It was funny because she had probably had them on for at least 20 minutes, but I think it was even longer than that. I grabbed them back. She grabbed me and started dancing with me. I will never forget that moment because literally all I could think was, \"Is this really happening to me?\" That never happened with me. I never got to dance with girls, much less get grabbed by them. We held hands and danced for a long time. Neither of us were very drunk; I was sober enough for it to be self-conscious and awkward feeling, but I was still having a good time. I didn\'t ever want it to end. I felt weird about it because I had brought a different girl to the party to try and impress her, but in this moment, I really didn\'t care. I didn\'t expect it to go anywhere, but I was holding her hands and dancing with her--I never wanted it to end. Before a long time at all, Megan and William decided that it was time to leave. She told me she had to go. I was disappointed that she was leaving so soon, but there was nothing I could really do about it.\n\n\"Hey! This was fun! Will you find me on Facebook?\" She gave me the strangest look of disdain. I didn\'t understand it. But without hesitating for even half a second, I corrected myself: \"No! No! I\'ll find YOU! What\'s your last name?\"\n\n\"Gilbert.\"\n\nAnd then she left. I didn\'t really know what to do at this point. I continued to mingle with my friends and have fun, but was sad it had ended so soon. I didn\'t know if I would ever even see her again. I might have stayed another hour or two, then I went home. Berenice wasn\'t feeling good, but when she felt good enough to go, her, David, and I left to walk home. We got home and I tucked Berenice in and went to sleep in my own bed. All I could think about was Clara. I stayed up so long thinking about her that night. I had even friended her on Facebook before I got in bed. While lying in bed, I decided I would ask for her number the next day, call her up, and immediately ask her out for dinner for the following weekend. It was a Saturday night. I would typically never have the confidence to do something so suddenly, but I guess that\'s just the kind of thing love at first sight does to you. I also didn\'t have much time before summer came and everyone left. I had no idea if she would be here for the summer.\n\nI woke up the next morning and sent her a message:\n<div>-\"CLARA!\"</div>\n<div>-\"RUSSELL!\"</div>\n<div>-\"so i guess we are friends now...\"</div>\n<div>-\"Of course we are! it was destiny.</div>\n<div>clara, I had so much fun dancing with you last night. I want to hang out more.\"</div>\n<div>-\"ok. done. i love adventures.\"</div>\n<div>-\"HAHA.</div>\n<div>perfect.</div>\n<div>what\'s your phone number?\"</div>\n<div>-\"478 251 1493</div>\n<div>you are only slightly creepy by the way, but thats ok, because I think you are fun.\"</div>\n<div>-\"haha what! why am I creepy??\"</div>\n<div>-\"finding me and asking for my number...</div>\n<div>its ok.\"</div>\n<div>-\"you don\'t make friends with people after you meet them?\"</div>\n<div>-\"you are probably looking at all my friends and pictures as we speak</div>\n<div>.... hahaha\"\n<div>-\"what kind of adventure do you want to go on?\"</div>\n<div>-\"well i have a feeling you are a pretty adventurous kid, so i am willing to let you make that call.\"Her calling me \"creepy\" robbed me of all the confidence I needed to call her up and ask her out right then and there. I sent her my number and a text or two, but was very conservative about it. Yet, the texts just continued back and forth; I didn\'t want to push it too hard. David and I were out shooting for our documentary, and Clara was in studio while we texted back in forth. Later, I got a text that made me terrified.\n\n-\"I need a break.\"\nI hesitated then responded:\n-\"From me sending you silly pictures?\"\n-\"From studio.\"\nMy heart leapt, but I was still hesitant. I had only met her the night before. It was around 3 o\'clock.\n-\"Did you want to meet up or do something?\"\n-\"Sure, I\'m going to church with a friend in about 2 hours, but I have a little time to kill before then.\"\n\nGood news. She\'s a Christian. That\'s cool. I got excited. I called her to ask what we wanted to do. I told her we didn\'t have much time, but I could come pick her up and we could go cruising around for a little bit. After taking care of the camera equipment and taking my project team back to their cars, I left to go meet up with her. She sat in the grass outside of the architecture building waiting. I didn\'t really know what we could do, but I wasn\'t extremely concerned or nervous. But I was nervous. We started driving and I suggested I could take her to a cool antique store in the Highlands that David and I had found. We went and browsed for a little bit, but it was already time for her to go for church. She was meeting a friend, and we were already a little late. She invited me, and we decided to meet her friend, Michael Chaney, there. It was such a good sign to me. We went, and I felt good vibes from her. Honestly, there wasn\'t really a time that I didn\'t get good vibes from her from the second I met her, with the exception of her calling me creepy. After getting out, Michael suggested exactly what I was hoping, \"Are you guys hungry?\" Clara was. They wanted to go to the new dining hall, which I had never gotten to go to since I hadn\'t had a meal plan since I had been a freshman and wanted to try out before I graduated. It was the perfect opportunity! As the night went on, we all ate dinner together and sat talking for a long time. We finally walked out the door and sat outside, talking and enjoying the night. It wasn\'t until ten o\'clock that we decided to go. Michael went back into his apartment at North Ave, and Clara and I walked down Techwood together, in the direction of both my car and her dorm. She had left her bag in my car. She got her bag and we stood there for a couple minutes. I asked her what she was going to do that night. She told me that she had to do laundry, but she hated doing it alone and all of her friends were busy (we had seen them as we walked down Techwood). I wanted to tell her I would come so badly, but I didn\'t want to push it too hard. I had only met her last night. And even though I thought she wanted me to, I wanted to play my cards right. We just sat there in silence and looked at each other. She smiled at me with the most charming smile that could drive a guy wild. And it drove me wild. I smiled back. We looked at each other without saying anything. It should have been awkward, but it wasn\'t. I felt so natural with her. I said goodbye and left. I was so ecstatic about how glorious the day had been. I met up with her a little bit before 5 o\'clock to possibly hang out for an hour and we had spent the entire evening together. I couldn\'t stop smiling.\n\nShe told me later that that moment was her favorite memory of us together: when we just looked at other smiling, not knowing what to do or say. She wanted to ask if I had any homework to do, if I wanted to come up to her room and study together. I would have said yes, but I suppose she was feeling the same way I was. I went home so happy and excited that night. I remember it vividly. I was already crazy about her.\n\nAnd after that, everything blurs together. It was a glorious three weeks, packed with time spent with her, school, graduation, finals, so much going on. I was living absolutely full speed. I\'m beginning to forget it all, but I would do anything to keep that from happening. It\'s all in my head, but I don\'t know how to extract it.\n\nThe next day, I felt much better. I just couldn\'t believe how well things had gone that day. We continued talking, continued texting. We found excuses to hang out. She told me about her \"double lofted megabed\" and her room. I was curious. She asked me to come study with her. We decided to pick up some beer, and I came over. We spent the evening doing homework together. I had gone over later in the evening, maybe 7 o\'clock. She talked the night before about how she didn\'t like sleeping alone, that her room was great for slumber parties. We relaxed, enjoyed each other\'s company, and got to know each other. It was a lucky night for me in that I didn\'t have that much work to do. I drank a lot more than she did. It got dark. It was dim in her room. As we sat in her room alone, she wrote me a message on a sticky note and stuck it to me. She wanted to kiss me. We went back and forth a few times. Then I kissed her. We spent time enjoying the moment, enjoying each other, learning the taste of each other. We thought about how we had met 2 nights earlier. We were lying down, and she got tired. She wanted to go to sleep. We laid in her bed until she fell asleep. I gave myself time to lie there and sober up, then I quietly got out of bed, slipped out the door, and drove home. That was the last night I ever slept alone until I graduated, she left for the summer, and we were forced apart.\n\n</div>\n<div>We did the same thing the next night, but this time I stayed. There wasn\'t really any question that I was going to. It was natural. From that day forward, we spent every second outside of class together. We ate lunch together, we ate dinner together, we spent time together every night, I went to visit her in studio, and I stayed with her every night.</div>\n</div>\n&nbsp;','For my love, wherever I may find her','','inherit','open','closed','','589-autosave-v1','','','2015-12-19 10:50:48','2015-12-19 15:50:48','',589,'http://journal.rruffles.com/589-autosave-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(843,2,'2015-12-20 13:42:18','2015-12-20 18:42:18','<p style=\"text-align: center;\">stay focused</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">be who you are</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">trust in a wise friend</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">live off the land</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">glide through dark times</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">be observant</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">treasure the quiet times</p>','advice from an owl','','publish','open','closed','','advice-from-an-owl','','','2015-12-20 13:42:18','2015-12-20 18:42:18','',0,'http://journal.rruffles.com/?p=843',0,'post','',0),(844,2,'2015-12-20 13:42:18','2015-12-20 18:42:18','<p style=\"text-align: center;\">stay focused</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">be who you are</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">trust in a wise friend</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">live off the land</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">glide through dark times</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">be observant</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">treasure the quiet times</p>','advice from an owl','','inherit','open','closed','','843-revision-v1','','','2015-12-20 13:42:18','2015-12-20 18:42:18','',843,'http://journal.rruffles.com/843-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(845,2,'2015-12-20 13:48:09','2015-12-20 18:48:09','The strangest thing happened to me a few days ago. I suppose it is not that strange. It\'s quite explicable if you think about it for more than a second, really. I needed a spot to relax for a bit, so I found a wonderfully quiet spot under a big tree in Freedom Park in the dark. I sparked up a joint and sat there for a few minutes. Before long, a group of four dark figures walked up, one carrying a flash light. They didn\'t look like the law, so I quickly put the joint away and sat there. They came up to me, man with flashlight in front, and he leaned down in front of me. He told me that he was with a charity and asked me if I want any food. I was taken by total surprise and didn\'t know how to react, so I just told him, \"No, I\'m okay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any blankets or jackets?\"\r\n\r\nQuietly and politely, \"No, I just want some peace.\"\r\n\r\nThey left and made a big loop around the section of the park before leaving. I think they had just come there for me. I hadn\'t been under the tree for more than five or ten minutes. I had noticed a tall boy in a bag as I approached the large trunk of the tree. So it made sense. But it was startling. Not all that bothersome, but it took me by surprise.\r\n\r\nIt at least proved a point to me, in the case that I hadn\'t noticed it already. Since I have been traveling the world by foot, many more interesting things happen in your daily life. Sure, they\'re typically only mildly interesting, but they\'re things that don\'t happen to you in your car; don\'t happen to you in your house; don\'t happen to you if you\'re not out walking around. Since I don\'t have a designated place that I can relax, I\'ve been wandering about. I\'ve been riding the bus. I\'ve been taking my time getting from place to place.\r\n\r\nYou get to hear other people\'s stories. Even if you\'re not looking for them. I\'m terrible at striking it up with other people.

I\'m glad you\'re having a good time on your hike. I can\'t wait for you to get back home where you belong (I hope). You\'ll be back in the U.S./society in no time and wishing you were back in New Zealand, but don\'t fall into the trap of always wishing you were somewhere else.

pundits keep telling us progressives that we didn’t listen to them in the heartland ― to you of the white working class, to you of conservative Christianity.</em>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"content-list-component text\">\r\n\r\n<em>Actually, I grew up as one of you. I’ve listened to you my whole life, but I don’t think I know how to understand you at all.</em>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"content-list-component text\">\r\n\r\n<em>I suppose now you’d consider me part of the so-called liberal elite. I’m a west coast university professor with a Ph.D. and almost 30 years of teaching experience. But I’m the daughter of a Southern Baptist, working-class pipe fitter at a paper mill in a small, conservative town in northwest Georgia.</em>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"content-list-component text\">\r\n\r\n<em>My parents did not go to college (my father finally earned a degree after he’d retired from the paper mill). Only one of my four grandparents finished high school. I studied hard, got a scholarship, kept studying, kept working and I moved into the white collar middle class.</em>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"content-list-component text\">\r\n\r\n<em>My white, conservative Christian upbringing had told me that was the American Dream ― to work hard and succeed. I did, and I feel you’re holding it against me now that I no longer share your views. I think you must imagine the liberal elite as East Coast, Ivy League-educated, trust fund babies completely out of touch with how most people live.</em>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"content-list-component text\">\r\n\r\n<em>Sure, some faculty members grew up with money. Some went to Ivy League schools. But a lot of us professors were you ― working class kids who did whatever it took to get a college education. Along the way, a lot of us developed progressive ideas, not out of our privilege, but out of our own experiences of discrimination, struggle and oppression.</em>\r\n<div class=\"content-list-component text\">\r\n\r\n<em>We read and argued and wrote and rewrote. We got peer-reviewed, over and over and over. Our ideas are held to incredibly high, rigorous standards, and so, when we speak we do so carefully, thoughtfully, with nuance, and with openness ― because sometimes we are also wrong. But because we’ve studied hard and held ourselves up to professional standards, we really do know a lot about what we’re talking about, and we have something to offer in a real conversation across our differences (including the East Coast Ivy Leaguers who aren’t as out of touch as you may think). But I don’t think you want to hear us or me.</em>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"content-list-component text\">\r\n\r\n<em>You tell me I need to “get over” Trump’s election and stop being a sore loser. But politics is not a sport. We don’t choose teams and simply cheer ours on to victory. My beloved Atlanta Falcons lost the Super Bowl, and, painful though that was, I will get over it. It hurts, but I won’t protest, march, write letters, or otherwise resist the outcome, even if we discover New England’s balls were deflated. It’s a game, but it’s not life or death.</em>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"content-list-component text\">\r\n\r\n<em>This election, however, is exactly that. Perhaps you can tell me to get over it because you do not have to worry that Trump will appoint a Supreme Court justice that could play a role in invalidating your marriage. If Congress passes and Trump signs the First Amendment Defense Act, you probably won’t have to worry that a bakery, restaurant, or hotel might legally deny you service. You don’t have to worry about being stranded at an airport and refused admission to the U.S. because of the country you’re from or the religion you practice. You don’t have to worry about having your family divided across the world with a simple signature on an executive order.</em>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"content-list-component text\">\r\n\r\n<em>You say you are aggrieved because you have not achieved what you think you deserve or you think some less deserving other has taken it. Despite having moved into the middle class, I have spent my career teaching about and advocating for labor unions, a living wage, affordable childcare, social security, affordable healthcare, accessible higher education. Progressives are actually the ones who support the economic programs and policies that could make a difference for the working class.</em>\r\n<div class=\"content-list-component text\">\r\n\r\n<em>You have a right to be aggrieved, but I fear you are targeting the wrong people. Low paying jobs, job insecurity, companies moving work overseas, low benefits, little vacation ― these are the results of decades of policies that benefit the truly wealthy ― those whose wealth depends not on the labor of their hands but on their ability to exploit the production of poorly paid laborers. The problem is not that immigrants have taken your jobs or drained money from the safety net. The problem is that the system of wealth sets workers against one another so they do not target the real economic power that limits their work and financial security.</em>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"content-list-component text\">\r\n\r\n<em>You say you want progressives to listen to you. Then prioritize truth. This election was filled with “fake news,” shared widely on Facebook, and this administration already has begun to create a language of “alternative facts” to misinform and mislead. If you want to talk, offer evidence, real evidence based on verifiable data and reliable sources, not wishful imaginings or fabricated Breitbart stories. An internet meme is not an informed and legitimate point of argument that facilitates dialogue. We’ve reached a point where you’d rather believe an overt lie if it supports a belief you already hold than pursue the truth if it might challenge your currently held belief.</em>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"content-list-component text\">\r\n\r\n<em>The Bible tells us God is a God of truth and the truth will set us free. Yet you chose someone who lies with impunity. I want to understand how you choose to ignore the evidence that is right in front of your eyes ― photos of the crowds at two different inaugurations, for example. How do you accept what is proven to be a lie? How do you support someone who, rather than correct the record, doubles down on his lies?</em>\r\n<div class=\"content-list-component text\">\r\n\r\n<em>Especially, how do you do this in the name of the God of truth? Before the election I saw one of you who’d written as an evangelical Christian in support of Trump that “God can use anyone.” So help me understand why you thought God could use a man who’d said he’d never asked God for forgiveness, who serially committed adultery, who said he could grab women by the genitals, who cheated contractors and workers, but you didn’t think God could use a woman who is a Christian, a lifelong Methodist and who, from the heart, quotes the Bible and John Wesley (when Trump didn’t even know how to say “Second Corinthians,” which he called “Two Corinthians,” and when asked for his favorite Bible verse struggled to name one until he landed on “an eye for an eye.” And you know what Jesus said about that one).</em>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"content-list-component text\">\r\n\r\n<em>I know you’ve been offended that progressives have called you racist for voting for Trump. I understand that. You don’t see yourself as racist. But you did knowingly vote for someone who insulted Latinos, Blacks, Muslims, and Jews. And women. And LGBTQ people. And people with disabilities. Help me understand how that squares with the notion of God’s love for all people.</em>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"content-list-component text\">\r\n\r\n<em>Can you really imagine Jesus using the words Trump did about these groups of people? How would you characterize voting for someone who is overtly racist? Help me understand how you align your Christian perspective with his racism, misogyny, homophobia, Islamophobia, and antisemitism.</em>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"content-list-component text\">\r\n\r\n<em>I’m afraid that what you want is a nation that conforms to your interpretation of the Bible. That’s where we really run into trouble because that would require you to force your particular conservative Christian beliefs on everyone else. I don’t understand how people who want to claim religious liberty for themselves are so unwilling to give it to everyone, which is actually the premise of true religious liberty.</em>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"content-list-component text\">\r\n\r\n<em>You say you want a Christian nation, but our founders were clear that was never their goal. In fact, the Constitution goes to great lengths to protect the government from religion and religion from government. I also get the sense that you think people are not Christians if they aren’t Christian in the same way as you. But can’t we find some common ground? Can’t we agree that all people should be free to practice their religion or practice no religion and should be safe from coercion based on religion? Can’t we agree that we share values of love, kindness, respect, and community and then try to live those with each other? Do you really think a Christian, especially a biblical literalist, can want a wall built?</em>\r\n<div class=\"content-list-component text\">\r\n\r\n<em>The Bible is clear about how we are to treat foreigners among us ― no matter how they got here. What if the Egyptians had built a wall before Mary and Joseph fled from King Herod? Our Christian story starts with a refugee family. Can we not practice our shared Christian values with immigrants and refugees coming to our country?</em>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"content-list-component text\">\r\n\r\n<em>Can’t we find common ground on issues like, say, abortion? I think we could have a common goal of lowering abortion rates. After all, you will never end abortions. Maybe you can end the safe, legal ones, but, one way or another, women will still have abortions. They will just be more likely to die from them.</em>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"content-list-component text\">\r\n\r\n<em>And here’s where I think dealing with facts is crucial to find common ground. We know that abortion rates are lower worldwide when there is no global gag order. We also know that what is most successful in lowering abortion rates is access to contraception, accurate sex education, and personal and economic empowerment for women.</em>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"content-list-component text\">\r\n\r\n<em>To cling to overturning Roe v. Wade as the only way to end abortions is a fantasy based on ideology rather than medical science and social science, and it flies in the face of the evidence for what is successful. So the real question is are you more interested in actual effectiveness in lowering abortion rates or ideological purity? We can lower abortion rates together but not by denying women choices over their own bodies. We can be effective together by listening to the data and working together to ensure all women have access to contraception, education, and social and economic resources. Are you willing to have that conversation?</em>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"content-list-component text\">\r\n\r\n<em>I’ve heard some of you say that we’ll just have to agree to disagree, but that’s a problem. You see, we’re not talking about ideas here. We’re talking about actual human lives. If we were talking about predestination or modes of baptism or premillennialism, I’d say, sure, let’s agree to disagree. The stakes are pretty low. But if we’re talking about the rights of people to access housing, clean water and air, and healthy food or the possibility of a nuclear arms race or discrimination written into law or women losing basic life-saving health screenings, or young black men being incarcerated disproportionately, or Native peoples having their sacred sites desecrated and their water poisoned, or Muslim people being targeted for their faith, then the stakes are much higher, and I cannot simply agree to disagree.</em>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"content-list-component text\">\r\n\r\n<em>That’s why I’m writing you now. We need to talk, and I don’t know how to talk to you anymore. I need to know, is it more important to you to win than to do good? Or can we build coalitions? Listen to science? Rely on real evidence? Be effective? Put the needs and rights of all others above ideologies? Can we live the love of God we claim? You want me to hear and understand you. I get that. I also want you to hear and understand the rest of the world that is not you or your kind. Because they too are God’s people and therefore are in the circle of those whom we must love. You taught me that when I was a child. If we can agree on that now, we have a place to start.</em>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">-Susan Shaw, February 11, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>','I’m afraid that what you want is a nation that conforms to your interpretation of the Bible.','','publish','open','closed','','im-afraid-that-what-you-want-is-a-nation-that-conforms-to-your-interpretation-of-the-bible','','','2017-02-20 10:37:34','2017-02-20 15:37:34','',0,'http://journal.rruffles.com/?p=874',0,'post','',0),(875,2,'2017-02-20 10:37:34','2017-02-20 15:37:34','<div class=\"content-list-component text\">\r\n\r\n<em>Plenty of pundits keep telling us progressives that we didn’t listen to them in the heartland ― to you of the white working class, to you of conservative Christianity.</em>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"content-list-component text\">\r\n\r\n<em>Actually, I grew up as one of you.

Winston gave it to me, and it was just a very stiff stick of incredibly potent oregano. I had never had oregano so potent, and I wanted to know how he made it so potent. I kept it alive for a while and then forgot to water it for just a few days, not long at all, and it started dying. It had gotten cold, too, so I thought that could have caused it. But I cut the dead stuff and later it grew new leaves. I spent tons of time in the spring cutting the tips off, and now it is doing great. Now that it is finally outside it is starting to get full. I am very excited to see how much it grows this summer.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://journal.rruffles.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_20170425_190736.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20170425_190736\" />\r\n\r\nHere you can see some other oreganos I bought.

At least, that&rsquo;s the buzz among efficiency mavens, who seem to spend all their time adding up microblogging&rsquo;s fiscal toll. Last year, Nucleus Research warned that Facebook shaves 1.5 percent off total office productivity; a Morse survey estimated that on-the-job social networking costs British companies $2.2 billion a year.<br /><br />But for knowledge workers charged with transforming ideas into products &mdash; whether gadgets, code, or even Wired articles &mdash; goofing off isn&rsquo;t the enemy. In fact, regularly stepping back from the project at hand can be essential to success. And social networks are particularly well suited to stoking the creative mind.<br /><br />Studies that accuse social networks of reducing productivity assume that time spent microblogging is time strictly wasted. But that betrays an ignorance of the creative process. Humans weren&rsquo;t designed to maintain a constant focus on assigned tasks. We need periodic breaks to relieve our conscious minds of the pressure to perform &mdash; pressure that can lock us into a single mode of thinking. Musing about something else for a while can clear away the mental detritus, letting us see an issue through fresh eyes, a process that creativity researchers call incubation. &ldquo;People are more successful if we force them to move away from a problem or distract them temporarily,&rdquo; observe the authors of Creativity and the Mind, a landmark text in the psychology and neuroscience of creativity. They found that regular breaks enhance problem-solving skills significantly, in part by making it easier for workers to sift through their memories in search of relevant clues.<br /><br />That doesn&rsquo;t mean that employees should feel free to play Minesweeper at will, however. According to Don Ambrose, a Rider University professor who studies creative intelligence, incubation is most effective when it involves exposing the mind to entirely novel information rather than just relieving mental pressure. This encourages creative association, the mashing together of seemingly unrelated concepts &mdash; a key step in the creative process.<br /><br />History is full of tales of revelations that were helped along by such conceptual collisions. Alastair Pilkington came up with the idea for float glass, the inexpensive successor to plate glass, while washing dishes; the grease that pooled atop the water inspired him to pour molten glass onto melted tin, resulting in a perfectly smooth pane. And George de Mestral had the initial brainstorm for Velcro during a 1941 hunting trip, when he noticed how difficult it was to pick Alpine burrs off of his clothes.<br /><br />This means that tweets about Lady Gaga&rsquo;s lingerie can help someone debugging Perl code. (Or a tweet about Perl code may help Lady Gaga&rsquo;s underwear stylist.) A random scrap of information can trigger just the right conceptual collision. It&rsquo;s hard to know which scrap might do the trick, but that&rsquo;s the beauty of social networks &mdash; they constantly produce potential sparks, for free.<br /><br />The participatory nature of Twitter and Facebook also makes them excellent tools for supercharging creativity. Users finely craft their bons mots to grab people&rsquo;s attention and perhaps earn a retweet or two.<br /><br />As football coaches have long preached, you should practice like you play. Twitter and Facebook give knowledge workers the chance to turn downtime into a game where creativity and insight are rewarded, if only with digital pats on the back. Formulating a clever tweet about the latest Clipse record may not have much to do with an engineer&rsquo;s current project, but it demands far more inspired energy than reading the sports page.
